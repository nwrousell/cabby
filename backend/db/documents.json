["code: AFRI 0090\n\nterm: Fall 2024\n\ntitle: An Introduction to Africana Studies\n\ndescription: \u201cAn Introduction to Africana Studies\u201d (AFRI0090), taught by Professor Francoise Hamlin, is an introductory lecture course that serves to introduce students to the study of the African diaspora. The scope of the course is broad, encompassing history, literature and culture, identity formation, and methodologies within the field. Many students also felt that the class helped them to develop their skills as writers. As it is introductory, the course has no prerequisites, and class members felt that none were needed for them to get the most out of the semester. Some mentioned that a basic knowledge of American history was helpful but, again, not necessary.\nReviewers praised Professor Hamlin highly, saying that she encouraged critical thought and participation. Respondents noted that she created a learning environment in which they felt comfortable engaging in stimulating discussion. Professor Hamlin primarily lectured from PowerPoint slides and held question and answer sections at the end of each class period; she also frequently invited guest lecturers from different fields within Africana studies. Though reviews were extremely complimentary of the professor and the course in general, some students suggested that Professor Hamlin make her lectures more dynamic and provide more time for discussion. Class members nonetheless found her to be very approachable and available outside of class through email and during office hours, and they noted that she gave excellent feedback.\nWork for the class included weekly response papers, three blogs, five blog responses, a multimedia project, and a final paper. Though the weekly readings could be long, the vast majority of respondents found these and other assignments to be relevant and thought provoking. Students\u2019 most frequently voiced criticism was that they would have liked slightly less reading in favor of more writing assignments.\nMost reviewers spent between five and seven hours per week on the course, and they said that anyone considering it should be prepared for a moderate amount of work. However, they also warned against being dissuaded from taking the course for this reason, as it was well worth the time commitment. As one student said, \u201cAn Introduction to Africana Studies\u201d is an \u201camazing experience that opens doors that you didn\u2019t even know were there.\u201d\n\ninstructor: Instructors\nFrancoise Hamlin\nfrancoise_hamlin@brown.edu\n\nschedule: Schedule and Location\nTTh 1pm-2:20pm in Smith-Buonanno Hall 201\n\nprograms: Curricular Programs\nRace, Power, and Privilege (RPP)\nWriting - Designated Courses (WRIT)\n\naverage_hours: 5.09\n\nmax_hours: 7.45\n\ncourse_rating: 83%\n4.67\n\nprofessor_rating: 92%\n4.87\n\nprofessor_and_term: AFRI 0090 | Hamlin, Francoise (S1) | Fall 2013\n\n", "code: AFRI 0140\n\nterm: Fall 2024\n\ntitle: First Lady of the Struggle: Mary McLeod Bethune and Global Black Freedom\n\ndescription: This course will focus on the life and legacy of Mary McLeod Bethune through an examination of her activism in the areas of education, politics, women's rights issues, civil rights issues, and world affairs. Throughout the course of her 79 years, she rose from humble beginnings in South Carolina, the daughter of formerly enslaved parents, to work with presidents and world leaders. She was born during the period of Reconstruction, and passed away the same year as the ruling of Brown vs. Board of Education was made, which will allow for a study of her participation in laying the foundation for the Modern Civil Rights Movement. Students will also gain experiential learning by visiting historic sites which preserve the legacy of Bethune, including the Mary McLeod Bethune Council House-National Historic Site and the Carter G.

Classes consisted of lectures interspersed with group discussions. There are no listed prerequisites for this course. Students found that background knowledge was not necessary, but that an interest in Africa was needed to fully enjoy the course.\nProfessor Jacobs was described as a highly effective and articulate lecturer as a result of her extensive knowledge of the subject matter and her passion for it. However, it was noted that Jacobs sometimes spoke too fast for students to keep up with the notes. Class members found the group discussions to be very effective in encouraging class participation, and noted that Jacobs was available during office hours and gave excellent feedback.\nCoursework consisted of two papers, three quizzes, a final research paper, and readings from the textbook and a sourcebook written by the professor. Readings were important to the course due to the lectures' focus on them. Students found readings useful, though somewhat monotonous in opinion. Students also felt that the sourcebook should be further organized and that more perspectives on 20th century African history could be offered. Opinions regarding the usefulness of the Shillington textbook varied.\nStudents suggested complementary courses from the Africana and History departments as good ones to take with AFRI0160. Work for this course took about three to ten hours a week on average. The suggested improvements focused on the readings, with students suggesting both a greater focus on the textbook and a larger variety of readings. On the whole, this course was enthusiastically recommended.\n\ninstructor: Instructors\nKim Gallon\nkim_gallon@brown.edu\n\nschedule: Schedule and Location\nTTh 9am-10:20am in List Art Center 220\n\naverage_hours: 3.79\n\nmax_hours: 8.75\n\ncourse_rating: 52%\n3.49\n\nprofessor_rating: 60%\n3.57\n\nprofessor_and_term: AFRI 0160 | Jacobs, Nancy (S1) | Spring 2011\n\n", "code: AFRI 0670\n\nterm: Fall 2024\n\ntitle: Global Black Radicalism\n\ndescription: From the Black Power Movement to the relationship between spirituality and politics, \u201cGlobal Black Radicalism\u201d (AFRI0670) offers an evaluation of Black revolutionary movements through history and their interactions with the present. While there are no requirements for the course, it is a Sophomore Seminar; therefore, enrollment is only available for students with a semester level of 03 or 04.\nProfessor Patrick Sylvain was praised by reviewers for being \u201cfunny, passionate, and determined to make students examine their own arguments critically.\u201d Professor Sylvain often incorporated current world events into discussions about history and is quoted to be \u201cone of the most knowledgeable professors.\u201d Time management during classes seemed to be an issue, according to a student, but the professor's vast knowledge of the field, consideration of students\u2019 needs, and helpful feedback made up for it.\nClass members reported spending four to six hours a week on the course, mainly on readings that were overall considered worthwhile and useful. Aside from the lengthy weekly readings, there was an extensive final paper, a 20 to 30-minute individual presentation centered around a reading of your choice, and a 20-minute group presentation. The individual presentation was described by a reviewer as a means to make \u201cthe class environment feel less centralized or hierarchical\u201d while initiating a learning process for everyone in the room, even for Professor Sylvain.\nAFRI0670 seeks to answer questions such as \u201cWhat led young activists to embrace \u2018Black Power?\u2019 What led to the emergence of Marxist movements in Portuguese Africa?

The course is limited to students semesters seven and above in the Africana Studies program.\nProfessor Brian Meeks was described as clearly passionate about both the course and his students. He frequently encouraged students to meet with him outside of class and was praised multiple times for weaving current events into the class. Despite the class being a seminar, Professor Meeks had the tendency to lecture, and would frequently step in to provide his own insight during discussions.\nThe course required students to lead a discussion section/presentation, which was supposed to analyze a specific reading, and then write one final 20-page paper, which was supposed to reflect the cumulative learning of the entire course. The readings had a lot of material but were also manageable. Despite the quantity, they were very relevant and grounded in the work of African thinkers and theorists.\nOverall, the course had a mix of great and good reviews, with a larger emphasis on the great. As said, Professor Meeks was praised multiple times for his passion and his willingness to be a resource for students outside of class. Some students wished for more diverse authors on the syllabus, including the addition of more black women.

This course draws upon the emergent performance and aesthetic practices as disruptions of colonial violence; and their relationship to racialized, gendered, and sexual power dynamics. This course will deeply consider what it means to be (in)human, erotic reconfigurations of being, and fugitive practice. We will draw from frameworks in performance studies, Black feminism, women of color feminism, and queer theory to understand the body as a living archive of memory, violence, and liberation.

Students taking the course will approach their readings with socially-attuned and historically-minded neo-formalist analyses to develop a relevant critical vocabulary for discussions, deepen their understanding of contemporary short fiction, and improve communication skills. While there are no prerequisites for the course, students expressed that having an interest in reading stories is central to enjoying the class. Previous experience with English and Literary Arts courses also proved to be useful.\nProfessor Ralph Rodriguez was praised by respondents for his creative approaches to literary analysis and for facilitating classroom discussions. Students felt that Professor Rodriguez was thoughtful, engaging, and passionate about the material. Most classes opened with a grounding reading or meditation and then transitioned into a student-led discussion. Although Professor Rodriguez pushed students to challenge themselves, respondents felt he was very accommodating in terms of fostering a safe classroom environment, considering student mental health and adjusting assignments accordingly.\nAssignments for the class included reading two short stories per week, which were sometimes accompanied by a craft essay. There were also three papers due throughout the semester.\nOne respondent described this course as the \u201cbest class\u201d they have taken at Bown.

In the 18-19th centuries, houses, furniture, whale products were staples of American craft and ingenuity. This material culture tells the story of how gathering raw materials and converting them into usable products came at a severe cost to watersheds, forests, species, humans.

Characterized by scholars as neo-slave narratives and, later, post-neo slave narratives, contemporary fictions of US slavery deploy the formal features and thematic concerns of the slave narrative to reveal Black freedom dreams of later periods. Examining recent literary, filmic, and televisual representations of US slavery, this course foregrounds racial slavery in the establishment of longstanding socioeconomic and political asymmetries across race, gender, and class in the US. And it analyzes the ways in which imaginative depictions of racial slavery seek to address and ameliorate such asymmetries. Our class will pay particular attention to how contemporary Black writers and filmmakers thematize labor, love, gender, power, pleasure, community, and resistance among the enslaved and their descendants.\n\ninstructor: Instructors\nAliyyah Abdur-Rahman\naliyyah_abdur-rahman@brown.edu\n\nschedule: Schedule and Location\nTTh 1pm-2:20pm in Sayles Hall 104\n\ncritical_review_url: http://www.thecriticalreview.org/AMST/1920A\n\n", "code: AMST 2010\n\nterm: Fall 2024\n\ntitle: Introduction to American Studies\n\ndescription: Introduction to American Studies required of all first-year graduate students in American Studies.

This course will focus on two interrelated themes. The first is the implementation of immigration and nationality controls designed to manage cross-border traffic and restrict membership in the national community. The second is to explore how the projection of US power beyond its territorial borders (e.g. US empire) has fueled cross-border movement between metropole and colonial/postcolonial zones. We will highlight the ways in which the US\u2019s encroachment of borders outside its territorial domain raises important questions about the meaning and legitimacy of national sovereignty and the fashioning of immigrant \u201cillegality.\u201d\n\ninstructor: Instructors\nRichard Baldoz\nrichard_baldoz@brown.edu\n\nschedule: Schedule and Location\nW 3pm-5:30pm in Nicholson House 101\n\ncritical_review_url: http://www.thecriticalreview.org/AMST/2221B\n\n", "code: AMST 2221D\n\nterm: Spring 2025\n\ntitle: Tracked: Critical Surveillance Studies\n\ndescription: This graduate seminar investigates historical and contemporary technologies and practices of surveillance, drawing on the established field of Surveillance Studies as well as relevant literature in performance studies, media ethnography, software/platform studies, sociology of labor, and history of science.

Students will consider Indigenous peoples\u2019 engagement with aesthetics as integral to the persistence of Indigenous paradigms. We will ask: How are aesthetics a critical site of both colonization and decolonial refusal? How can we collectively explore the relational capacities and overtones imbued within Indigenous and minoritarian aesthetics? How do activists, artists, writers, etc. employ aesthetics as the conduit to building anticolonial solidarities across diverse contexts? We will explore the sensory paradigms framing aesthetics asking how these register within the body and the environment to build, sustain, and live in otherwise worlds.

Students also looked into the management, development, and governance of nonprofit organizations. Reviewers noted that any experience with museum history, art history, and related undergraduate courses was helpful to be successful in this class.\nProfessor Lubar, frequently referred to as Steve, was praised for his lecturing abilities, as well as his accommodating nature and deep empathy for his students throughout the semester, especially as the course transitioned to remote learning. He was flexible with his schedule and made himself available outside of class to be a resource for his students. Students lauded Professor Lubar's emphasis on creating a good balance between lecture and discussion through guest speakers and interactive online student work, and appreciated his dedication to establishing a good rapport with the class.\nEach week, students were required to complete between two and four readings, papers, and/or discussion posts, and attend meetings with Professor Lubar to revise project proposals. Students also completed one group project and two individual projects throughout the semester. Students spent, on average, between five to ten hours per week preparing for class, but that increased to fifteen hours during busier weeks.\nOverall, respondents highly enjoyed taking \u201cMethods in Public Humanities\" (AMST2540). Students found the class to be most relevant for careers working in public humanities, public programming, museums, or other cultural institutions, but highly encouraged anyone interested in these fields to take this course!\n\ninstructor: Instructors\nSteven Lubar\nsteven_lubar@brown.edu\n\nschedule: Schedule and Location\nTTh 2:30pm-3:50pm Location TBD\n\naverage_hours: 6.83\n\nmax_hours: 14.67\n\ncourse_rating: 66%\n4.08\n\nprofessor_rating: 80%\n4.50\n\nprofessor_and_term: AMST 2540 | Lubar, Steven (S1) | Fall 2020\n\n", "code: AMST 2990\n\nterm: Fall 2024\n\ntitle: Thesis Preparation\n\ndescription: For graduate students who have met the residency requirement and are continuing research on a full time basis.\n\ninstructor: Instructors\nTBD\n\ncritical_review_url: http://www.thecriticalreview.org/AMST/2990\n\n", "code: ANTH 0066J\n\nterm: Fall 2024\n\ntitle: So You Want to Change the World?\n\ndescription: So you want to change the world? Then check out Professor Daniel Smith\u2019s first-year seminar \u201cSo You Want to Change the World?\u201d (ANTH0066J)! This class critically examines the efforts to address global poverty that are typically labeled as \u201cdevelopment\u201d through ethnographic case studies. There are no prerequisites as this is a course reserved for first-years, although one student noted that previous experience writing lengthy research papers is beneficial.\nProfessor Smith received high praise for his interesting lectures, encouragement of student discussion, and his passion for the material. Many reviewers praised his willingness to let students engage in class discussions; they also appreciated his stories about working in the Peace Corps and presentations about his own research. A few individuals felt that additional input or instruction from Professor Smith would have been beneficial.\nThis course was described as reading-heavy across the board, with about a book (~200 pages) of reading assigned per week. The readings were described as \u201cinteresting\u201d and \u201cilluminating\u201d, although one reviewer did note the volume of reading was difficult to balance with intensive STEM courses. \u201cSo You Want to Change the World?\u201d required three two-page response papers and one 20-page research paper throughout the semester.\nRespondents did not feel that this class put a significant strain on their time, spending an average of six hours on the reading and writing assignments. One reviewer advised that students should be \u201cprepared to talk about tough subjects like race, poverty, the environment, and capitalism.\u201d Overall, if you are interested in understanding global inequality and efforts to alleviate it, this may be the course for you.\n\ninstructor: Instructors\nDaniel Smith\ndaniel_j_smith@brown.edu\n\nschedule: Schedule and Location\nW 3pm-5:30pm in Giddings House 212\n\nprograms: Curricular Programs\nFirst Year Seminar (FYS)\nRace, Power, and Privilege (RPP)\nWriting - Designated Courses (WRIT)\n\naverage_hours: 6.29\n\nmax_hours: 10.33\n\ncourse_rating: 56%\n3.75\n\nprofessor_rating: 80%\n4.32\n\nprofessor_and_term: ANTH 0066J | Smith, Daniel (S1) | Fall 2021\n\n", "code: ANTH 0100\n\nterm: Spring 2025\n\ntitle: Introduction to Cultural Anthropology\n\ndescription: \"Introduction to Cultural Anthropology\" (ANTH0100) is a course taught by Professor Andrea Flores that aims to present students with the various methods of anthropology as well as a survey of its theories and history. There are no official prerequisites, and many respondents noted that it was their very first class in the department or even their first humanities course at Brown.\nProfessor Flores received positive reviews from students. The format of the course, which consisted of PowerPoint lectures, was deemed an effective way to present the material. Students were also required to attend a weekly discussion section, which was found to be helpful in understanding the assigned readings. Although some noted that the content of the lectures themselves could be dull, class participants thought that the instructor's style was clear, informative, and engaging. Additionally, respondents found her to be extremely approachable and available outside of class, with multiple students commenting that she was quite helpful in her office hours. She also emphasized using hands-on activities to help teach the class. Additionally, the TA for the course received very favorable reviews and was described as a valuable resource when completing the written work.\nAssignments required for ANTH0100 included three short response papers, two three-page anthropological method papers (the lowest grade of which was dropped), and two final papers that were five pages each. Students were also required to complete readings for each week, which some students found could be rather dense and lengthy at times. However, although the class sometimes had to read an entire book in a single week, respondents thought the readings were generally interesting and necessary for understanding the course material. Furthermore, some students felt that the written assignments were rather difficult to approach and were graded more harshly than anticipated; others noted that one had to synthesize the readings in an academic way for the response papers.\nOverall, course participants were satisfied with their experience in Professor Flores's course, which served as an accessible introduction to the study of cultural anthropology. While some expressed a desire for a more diverse lecture format and less extensive reading requirements, all recommended the class to future students. Additionally, they also recommended that shoppers look into other similar courses that provide a comparable exposure to anthropology as an academic discipline.\n\ninstructor: Instructors\nMyles Lennon\nmyles_lennon@brown.edu\n\nschedule: Schedule and Location\nMW 11am-11:50am Location TBD\n\nprograms: Curricular Programs\nRace, Power, and Privilege (RPP)\nWriting - Designated Courses (WRIT)\n\naverage_hours: 3.44\n\nmax_hours: 6.56\n\ncourse_rating: 64%\n4.33\n\nprofessor_rating: 88%\n4.75\n\nprofessor_and_term: ANTH 0100 | Flores, Andrea (S1) | Spring 2016\n\n", "code: ANTH 0300\n\nterm: Fall 2024\n\ntitle: Culture and Health\n\ndescription: \u201cCulture and Health\u201d (ANTH0300), taught by Professor Sherine Hamdy, provides an introduction to the social implications of diseases and how humans deal with such problems. Although there are no listed prerequisites, respondents contended that a university-level writing course was very helpful for completing this class. Additionally, many students believed that other courses dealing with issues of people and health, such as ANTH0110 and PLCY0100, promoted their learning.\nProfessor Hamdy was praised for being very passionate and knowledgeable during her lectures. However, reviewers were divided on how they felt about the content of the lectures. They were unanimously described as unstructured and somewhat hard to follow, with Professor Hamdy using the blackboard and showing videos. Half of respondents thought that these lectures were not effective at all, being very confusing and somewhat tangential. The other half believed that the lectures were very effective, despite being hard to follow, and that the professor explained terms and concepts very well and organically. Outside of class, students found it extremely difficult to meet with Professor Hamdy, some saying an appointment had to be made two weeks in advance. However, they asserted that the TAs were very reliable and available for help, and sections were also beneficial for comprehension.\nClass members described the workload as relatively heavy, with weekly readings of about one book a week, five 500-word papers based on the readings, section participation and pop quizzes, and a final project, which was a choice of a five- to seven-page paper, a video, a graphic novel, or some other creative project. Students liked how the sections and papers made them better writers and better analyzers of text. They also approved of how the readings and papers were overall relevant, although some stated that a couple readings strayed. Students also noted that the readings were not too difficult and became easier over time as expectations were better understood. In addition, reviewers found that feedback on papers as well as a student note-taking Google Documents were very useful. However, many respondents were frustrated by what they viewed as harsh grading of essays.\nAs a whole, students enjoyed the course and the professor\u2019s teaching style very much. One student described their experience as \u201cmore than learning facts, I felt like I\u2019m learning wisdom.\u201d However, reviewers definitely agreed that students should be prepared for a substantial workload and should try not to procrastinate. Overall, respondents recommended this course for people going into medicine, as well as anyone interested in bioethics, although they cautioned students who have already taken a medical anthropology course that this class would likely be repetitive.\n\ninstructor: Instructors\nKatherine Mason\nkatherine_mason@brown.edu\n\nschedule: Schedule and Location\nMW 11am-11:50am in Metcalf Research Building AUD\n\nprograms: Curricular Programs\nRace, Power, and Privilege (RPP)\nWriting - Designated Courses (WRIT)\n\naverage_hours: 4.33\n\nmax_hours: 8.31\n\ncourse_rating: 66%\n4.08\n\nprofessor_rating: 72%\n4.06\n\nprofessor_and_term: ANTH 0300 | Hamdy, Sherine (S1) | Spring 2016\n\n", "code: ANTH 0301\n\nterm: Spring 2025\n\ntitle: Gender and Politics\n\ndescription: This course focuses on ideologies of gender and sexuality cross-culturally and how they influence peoples' involvement in political processes.

Through the discipline of biological anthropology, students are taught to use an evolutionary perspective to understand the interplay between biology and culture in shaping the human condition. Topics include evolution and adaptation, biocultural adaptation, fossil evidence, behavioral evolution in primates, human genetic variation and contemporary human biological variation. The course had no prerequisites, and respondents considered background in anthropology and biology helpful but not necessary.\nProfessor Andrew Scherer was described as a knowledgeable speaker, and his presentation slides were considered effective. However, students unanimously agreed that they would have benefited from the slides or lecture recordings being made available to the class for their studies. Respondents especially felt that this access would have improved components of the class that relied upon visual material, such as identifying bones and fossils.\nThe course requirements consisted of weekly readings, three in-class exams, three papers based on the readings, and a section once a week. Respondents noted that the exams were memorization-heavy, however, the material that they were tested on was interesting. Students did find that they learned a huge amount of material over the course of this class.\nOverall, students found the course to be interesting. Prospective students should note that although the exams were considered difficult.

Is it to be avoided or embraced? To what ends? The answers to these questions are not just personal or psychological. Rather, they are deeply sociocultural and historical. Orientations toward suffering shape major aspects of life, such as religion, politics, humanitarianism, and medicine. This course explores different ways that society and culture create suffering, and ways that suffering shapes society and culture. This happens not just in suffering itself but also in ways that people try to overcome suffering. Therefore, we also consider the relationship of compassion, empathy and sympathy, and other forms of care to suffering, always paying close attention to questions of the unequal distributions of both suffering and compassion to different groups of people.\n\ninstructor: Instructors\nMichael Berman\nmichael_berman@brown.edu\n\nschedule: Schedule and Location\nMW 10am-10:50am in 85 Waterman Street 015\n\nprograms: Curricular Programs\nRace, Power, and Privilege (RPP)\n\ncritical_review_url: http://www.thecriticalreview.org/ANTH/0350\n\n", "code: ANTH 0530\n\nterm: Summer 2024\n\ntitle: Archaeology of Psychoactive Substances\n\ndescription: This course examines the varying roles of psychoactive substances and altered states of consciousness in both past and present cultural practice.

Several mentioned his kindness, and one said he was their favorite professor at Brown. Professor Berman led discussions well and encouraged participation from the class throughout lectures. He presented material effectively, using a variety of formats.\nCoursework consisted of regular readings and completing five semiotic discussion posts on Canvas, which replaced reading responses for discussion sections. Professor Berman also assigned a reading response paper (a second one was cancelled after classes became remote) and a final group project. The midterm consisted of a ten minute oral exam, and one reviewer noted that the assignments felt reasonable.\nOverall, students enjoyed the class and were enthusiastic in their encouragement for others to take it. Respondents did not make any suggestions for improvement, though one pointed out that prospective students might not enjoy it if they do not want to reconsider their conceptions of gender, race, and class.

However, some students noted that having taken statistics classes or archaeology classes was helpful in preparation for the course.\nProfessor VanValkenburgh received positive reviews from students. Students found him to be passionate and energetic in his lecturing style, and he effectively led them through complicated procedures step by step. Some students wished he had spent more time on workshop project ideas so that everyone could discuss them as a class. Respondents described Professor VanValkenburgh as always available and quick to respond. They also appreciated that he also left time during class to answer questions. In addition, many respondents felt it was especially helpful that Professor VanValkenburgh held office hours immediately after class.\nThe course assignments included ten weekly labs, optional readings, and one final project and poster. Some students noted that the assignments were challenging, while others found the assignments to be relatively easy. Despite the varying opinions, respondents generally agreed that the assignments were very helpful and worthwhile. Students reported working on average about five hours a week on coursework and about 11 hours at most.\nOverall, participants enjoyed the unique opportunity this course provided, learning the skills to create beautiful, clear maps. Regarding areas of improvement, some wished there were more PowerPoint resources, while others wished more time was spent on spatial and statistical analyses.

With its \"Community-Based Learning and Research\" designation, the course encourages a hands-on approach to learning. Students observe local 12-step recovery meetings in the community and conduct anthropological interviews regarding substance misuse. There are no prerequisites for this course, although reviewers generally noted that prior anthropology knowledge was helpful for success in the course. One respondent indicated that solid reading and writing skills could also be beneficial as assignments were reading and writing-heavy.\nProfessor Irene Glasser was praised as a thorough, knowledgeable instructor, and respondents had a generally positive view of her teaching. However, a few commented that the discussion could sometimes feel disorganized and a bit slow due to the length of the seminar-style class. One respondent saw a benefit to this relaxed teaching style, noting that it meant the class wasn't as fast-paced. Still, students all seemed to appreciate the interesting variety of activities Professor Glasser introduced to facilitate learning.\nAssignments included papers, weekly readings, and opportunities to speak to community organizations and book authors to understand addiction better. Respondents noted that the readings could be time-consuming but were exciting and worthwhile to complete. Professor Glasser's grading was thought to be extremely lenient, and respondents noted that paper answers were discussed during class.\nOverall, students enjoyed this course. One reviewer noted it to be \"super chill and really interesting\" and mentioned an activity involving an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting to be the most interesting part of the course. The course is recommended to concentrators and non-concentrators alike, with one student praising its accessibility. Due to its small class size, shoppers should know that securing a spot may be challenging. Any student interested in the anthropological method of ethnography or the anthropology of addiction should most definitely look into this course.\n\ninstructor: Instructors\nIrene Glasser\nirene_glasser@brown.edu\n\nschedule: Schedule and Location\nW 3pm-5:30pm in Giddings House 202\n\nprograms: Curricular Programs\nCommunity-Based Learning and Research (CBLR)\nWriting - Designated Courses (WRIT)\n\naverage_hours: 3.13\n\nmax_hours: 6.75\n\ncourse_rating: 67%\n4.22\n\nprofessor_rating: 85%\n4.75\n\nprofessor_and_term: ANTH 1300 | Glasser, Irene (S1) | Fall 2023\n\n", "code: ANTH 1301\n\nterm: Spring 2025\n\ntitle: Anthropology of Homelessness\n\ndescription: \"Anthropology of Homelessness\" (ANTH1301) is a seminar course that explores \"causes, conditions, and responses to homelessness\" from an anthropological and ethnographic lens. Though some respondents had previous experience taking classes in anthropology or working with homeless populations, most remarked that no particular background was necessary to succeed in the course.\nStudents praised Professor Irene Glasser for her knowledge of the course content and for her role as a facilitator in class discussions. Professor Glasser also facilitated Skype sessions with guest speakers and provided many handouts that students found helpful in pulling out the most important information from the readings. Some students thought that the class lectures could feel long and dry at times, or that the some seminar discussions lacked sufficient structure. Regardless, respondents stated that Professor Glasser graded assignments in a timely fashion and provided excellent feedback. In addition, class members found that she was very accessible outside of class and always willing to talk with students.\nThe assignments for this course consisted of weekly readings, three short papers, two in-class exams, as well as community placements, where students volunteered for two hours a week with Providence homeless populations and took field notes. Students generally found the assignments to be very relevant to the course, and particularly enjoyed the opportunity to volunteer with local homeless populations in the community. Respondents generally said that the course workload was manageable, though they wished that a paper due date and exam had not been scheduled on the same day. A few also wished there had been more guidance on how to write the field notes.\nOverall, respondents found the coursework rewarding, and were grateful for the opportunities to gain hands-on fieldwork experience. Students additionally appreciated the Skype calls they had with the authors of the books they read for class. Some class members thought the course could be improved by having fewer weekly readings, so that more time could be dedicated to each book or article.

Through this course, students learned the social, cultural, and structural components that affect global epidemics. Students agreed that no background is necessary to succeed in this course, but noted other courses in the anthropology and public health departments as helpful.\nStudents described Professor Nading's lecture style as effective, praising his use of real world examples and case studies. Although some students complained of sparse PowerPoint slides and big words which inhibited note-taking, many students expressed an interest in increased questioning and discussion time in class. Students described both the professor and TAs as very available and prompt in responses to emails.\nCourse requirements included weekly readings and corresponding quizzes which took the form of essay responses (13 total) as well as a final take-home essay. Students were also required to attend section discussions. Perceptions of the difficulty of the quizzes and readings were highly variable, but all students described them as relevant to the course.\nOverall, Nading's passion and experience were commended by the students. They also felt that they learned a lot of interesting material. In terms of possible improvements for the course, students wished for clearer and more specific guiding questions on the weekly quizzes and more structure in the section meetings. Overall, students highly recommended this course to concentrators and non-concentrators alike, and widely cited \"Culture & Health\" as a comparable course to take instead of or in conjunction with this course.\n\ninstructor: Instructors\nTBD\n\nschedule: Schedule and Location\nF 3pm-5:30pm Location TBD\n\nprograms: Curricular Programs\nRace, Power, and Privilege (RPP)\nWriting - Designated Courses (WRIT)\n\naverage_hours: 4.95\n\nmax_hours: 8.00\n\ncourse_rating: 65%\n4.06\n\nprofessor_rating: 85%\n4.59\n\nprofessor_and_term: ANTH 1310 | Nading, Alexander (S1) | Spring 2019\n\n", "code: ANTH 1311\n\nterm: Spring 2025\n\ntitle: Language and Medicine in Practice\n\ndescription: \"Language and Medicine in Practice\" (ANTH1311) studies language, medicine, and society through volunteer and observation work in clinical settings with an anthropological context. The course has no official prerequisites but is open to 20 students through an application process, with priority given to members of the Engaged Scholars Program, Anthropology concentrators, and seniors. Reviewers felt that a background in linguistic and medical anthropology was crucial to succeed in this course, and some mentioned having taken \"Introduction to Cultural Anthropology\" (ANTH0100) and \"Culture and Health\" (ANTH0300).\nProfessors Paja Faudree and Sherine Hamdy co-taught this course. Professor Faudree is a linguistic anthropologist and Professor Hamdy is a medical anthropologist. Both professors were praised for their encouragement of discussion during class time. Students wrote that both were busy after class, so they found it most helpful to sign up for meetings on the professors' Google sheets.\nThe course required readings, two short papers, one field notes description, eight hours of field work, one final group presentation, and one final group paper. Some students felt the assignments were challenging, but most agreed that they were all relevant to the course goals. Students spent an average of four and a half hours on work outside of class, though that number could increase to eight hours during busy weeks.\nReviewers enjoyed ANTH1311 and felt the fieldwork, professors, and group discussions were the highlights of the course. Some felt the course could be improved with more explanation of the concepts and more structure. Most students were highly satisfied with their experience.

Material covered abstractly was often linked to specific examples in US culture and politics and considered critically. Students expressed that \"it made me really think through everything I assume to be 'true' in development\". Others agreed that previous coursework in political science, sociology, anthropology, and especially other development studies courses would be very helpful for anyone taking this class.\nRecommenders found Professor Daniel Smith to be passionate and friendly. The class was entirely discussion-based, which many students enjoyed, though some showed desire for a bit more structure and information from the professor's deep bank of expertise. One student expressed that \"Smith has been the best leader of seminar discussions I've ever had.\" Notably, multiple students commented on not only the strength of the professor, but also the passion and knowledge of their classmates. Almost every evaluator praised Professor Smith's detailed and helpful feedback on assignments. Students indicated that Professor Smith was very available and responsive to emails.\nCoursework for ANTH1320 included in-class discussion, three four-page response papers, and a final, 20-page research paper. Assignments were generally open-ended, but students wished more class time had been dedicated to familiarizing the students with the material. Students were required to submit discussion questions before each class, but some students felt that this was unnecessary because discussions generally created questions as they unfolded.\nOverall, students found this class thought-provoking and enjoyable. Although students agreed that the course was challenging, many found the interactiveness of it to be deeply motivating and effective. Doing the readings was incredibly rewarding and students stressed the importance of time management when it came to completing readings and response papers.

The course includes lectures and a significant laboratory component working with real human skeletons. Since the labs required memorizing skeletal anatomy, respondents felt memorization and drawing ability would be useful preparation. However, most students felt that a biology background was not necessary to succeed.\nProfessor Rachel Kalisher received overwhelmingly positive reviews. Respondents found her lectures incredibly effective and appreciated her patience in working individually with students. Professor Kalisher utilized a combination of slides, whiteboard drawings, and real bones during lectures; reviewers found this varied modality beneficial to their understanding. One student suggested that she provide an online resource for the anatomical landmarks covered during lecture, as it was sometimes unclear which terms students were responsible for knowing.\nThe assignments for ANTH1720 consisted of readings for each class, weekly quizzes that involved the identification of bones, the maintenance of a notebook with sketches of bones, a group project toward the end of the semester, and a final exam. In addition to scheduled class times, students were allocated six \u201cbone hours\u201d per week. These extra laboratory sessions were considered crucial to learning the requisite anatomy. One respondent encouraged shoppers not to be intimidated by the bone quizzes, as \u201cyou become very well acquainted with the bones\u201d over the semester.\nOverall, reviewers considered ANTH1720 a valuable course with wide-ranging applications both in anthropology and the life sciences. They generally felt the course was well-paced and flexible, although some found it more challenging than expected. Shoppers are cautioned to ensure they can attend bone hours regularly.

This course will consider how fiction and ethnography can each inform yet trouble the other, beginning from the premise that both involve a kind of magic. Using the same building blocks \u2013 seemingly humble and ostensibly available to all --writers of fiction and ethnography alike create what one contemporary author has called \u201clanguage-made hallucinations, fabrications that persuade us to believe in them.\u201d Yet these \u201cfabrications\u201d often have different stakes and use different methods for revealing human \u201ctruths.\u201d We\u2019ll explore such divergences and alignments by seeing what is provoked when juxtaposing fiction, ethnography, and even other genres of writing (poetry, journalism, creative non-fiction, etc.).

The course prerequisite is \"Introductory Calculus, Part II\" (MATH0100) or equivalent.\nProfessor Virginia Kilikian taught the second section of this course. Professor Kilikian was praised for being an effective communicator over email, and for always being willing to help. Most students reported her lectures as being clear and passionately delivered, but there were a couple of students who felt the lectures could run a bit dry at times. The majority of respondents felt that Professor Kilikian's presentation of material was effective and that she was very responsive to questions.\nThe course required ten homework assignments, and a few quizzes. Students felt that the assignments were challenging if not time-consuming, but were posted well in advance and relevant to the course goals. The homework assignments accounted for the majority of the grade. There was no final exam. Students reported spending an average of five hours on assignments per week, though the average maximum amount of time respondents spent reached nine hours per week.\nStudents suggested that to improve the class, more MATLAB coding tutorials could be covered during class time. Interested shoppers are encouraged to take \"Introduction to Scientific Computing and Problem Solving\" (CSCI0040), along with other introductory APMA courses.

Students nearly unanimously agreed that the lecture-based teaching was more effective. They also appreciated Professor Kinnaird\u2019s passion, humor, and liveliness and were impressed that she learned everyone\u2019s name in such a large course. Class members stated that Professor Kinnaird was very available via office hours, meetings, and appointments on Google Calendar and also gave detailed feedback on exams.\nCourse assignments consisted of pre-class preparation activities, textbook readings, two short reflective papers, homework assignments, three midterms, and one final, which only had to be taken if students did not complete all 15 course standards or didn\u2019t attain their desired grade. Surveyors thought the homeworks were difficult and quite time consuming but were mostly relevant to course goals. They also stated that the homework questions and exam questions were very different.\nStudents thought the most unique part of the course was the non-numerical EMPX (exemplary, mastery, performance, X) grading scale. Most students found this grading confusing, subjective, and frustrating despite its intention to lower the stress associated with numerical grades, and a majority of students called for it to be removed in the future. Some other suggestions from class members included continuing the lecture-based teaching style, having less homework, and focusing less on R coding. Professor Kinnaird wants future students to know that this is not a low work course and that she expects students to commit the full 180 hours to the course; however, students will learn a lot if they stay on top of work and do all the assignments. In future iterations of the course, she plans to foster community by implementing \u201cstudy pods\u201d of 10-15 students each with an assigned TA. Students suggest that potential students shop APMA0650 before taking it to become aware of the grading system and course assignments, and recommend interested shoppers also look at \"Statistical Analysis of Biological Data\" (BIOL0495) or \"Statistical Inference I\" (APMA1650).\n\ninstructor: Instructors\nAmalia Culiuc\namalia_culiuc@brown.edu\n\nschedule: Schedule and Location\nTTh 1pm-2:20pm Location TBD\n\naverage_hours: 7.60\n\nmax_hours: 12.70\n\ncourse_rating: 52%\n3.26\n\nprofessor_rating: 71%\n4.01\n\nprofessor_and_term: APMA 0650 | Kinnaird, Katherine (S1) | Spring 2017\n\n", "code: APMA 1070\n\nterm: Spring 2025\n\ntitle: Quantitative Models of Biological Systems\n\ndescription: \"Quantitative Models of Biological Systems\" (APMA1070) is a course intended to introduce students to quantitative models applied to topics in biology such as population dynamics, infectious diseases, enzyme kinetics, and cellular biology. Official prerequisites include one of two course sequences in the Applied Mathematics department: APMA0330 and APMA0340 or APMA0350 and APMA0360. Many students indicated that \"Statistical Inference I\" (APMA1650), \"Linear Algebra\" (MATH0520), and background courses in biology also helped prepare them for the course.\nWhile students agreed that Professor Lucien Bienenstock was passionate about the material, they held mixed reviews about his lecturing style and content. Some class members liked that Professor Bienenstock was open to questions during class, but wished the lectures were more structured so that they did not feel disjointed. Many students also felt that Professor Bienenstock would sometimes go off topic during lecture, but they appreciated that he posted lecture notes. In terms of availability, many respondents lauded Professor Bienenstock for his availability and willingness to meet with students outside of class.\nAssignments for this course included weekly readings, eight homework assignments, a midterm exam, and a final project. While most students found the homework assignments to be relatively difficult and time consuming, overall they thought the assignments were very relevant to the course goals. In addition, most students who found the assignments difficult said that going to office hours helped them complete and understand the assignments.\nReviewers greatly enjoyed the interdisciplinary subject material of the course, but still had some suggestions for improvement. Many wanted more structured and clear lectures, and more review on basic concepts in the beginning of the course to ground their understanding of later topics. Overall, many students stated they liked the professor and appreciated his enthusiasm for the course topics and his willingness to help them.

Its prerequisites include a course in statistical inference and linear algebra, and experience with programming is required. Reviewers also found \u201cStatistical Inference I\u201d (APMA1650) helpful.\nStudents highly regarded Professor Matthew Harrison\u2019s instruction. He effectively connected previous material with current content, making it easier to understand. While he sometimes brushed over more difficult content, he was receptive to feedback and willing to clarify concepts upon request. He closely followed lecture notes, provided clear explanations supplemented with graphs, and encouraged questions during lectures. However, some students may have preferred more practice problems to reinforce learning, as the course focused more on theoretical concepts and proofs rather than their practical application. Professor Harrison was a clear and passionate lecturer, though his teaching style may not have suited everyone's preferences.\nCourse assignments consisted of ten weekly problem sets, three take-home quizzes, and an in-person final exam. Most of the grade and effort came from the lengthy homework, which included readings, statistics problems, and programming. Respondents found the homework well-structured, relevant, and excellent preparation for the relatively low-stakes exams.\nOverall, reviewers enjoyed the course, both for its content and for the instructor. Students should keep in mind that this course heavily relies on coding to analyze data and distributions, particularly using MATLAB. While the homework assignments may be time-consuming due to the extensive use of code, the quizzes focus more on conceptual understanding of algorithms. It's important to note that prior MATLAB experience is highly beneficial. Also, the TAs were incredibly helpful throughout the semester, and attending TA hours can provide valuable assistance with debugging.

Those seeking a different instructional approach may consider exploring alternative courses or instructors.\n\ninstructor: Instructors\nJerome Darbon\njerome_darbon@brown.edu\n\nschedule: Schedule and Location\nMWF 9am-9:50am Location TBD\n\naverage_hours: 6.60\n\nmax_hours: 12.00\n\ncourse_rating: 52%\n3.88\n\nprofessor_rating: 79%\n4.40\n\nprofessor_and_term: APMA 1160 | Keith, Brendan (S1) | Fall 2023\n\n", "code: APMA 1170\n\nterm: Fall 2024\n\ntitle: Introduction to Computational Linear Algebra\n\ndescription: Interested in both Computer Science and Applied Mathematics? Just want to do a bunch of proofs? Look no further than \"Introduction to Computational Linear Algebra\" (APMA1170), an upper-level APMA course that combines all of the above. The syllabus states that students in the class learn Gaussian elimination and LU factorization, QR factorization and Least-Squares Solutions, eigenvalue problems, iterative methods for solving linear systems, and more. Although there are no formally recognized prerequisites, students cited several classes and experiences as being beneficial to their success in the course, namely \"Linear Algebra\" (MATH0520 or MATH0540) and previous exposure to MATLAB.\nProfessor Johnny Guzman was described as effective, engaging, and passionate about the course material. He and the TAs held weekly office hours, and students remarked that he promptly responded to emails. Professor Guzman valued student input and would sometimes cold call people during class to increase participation. In turn, he was also very receptive to questions during lecture.\nAssignments included a midterm, a final, and about ten homework assignments. These assignments ranged in difficulty, but nearly every student stated that the homeworks were extremely relevant and necessary to the course. Students found that although the homework tended to be more difficult than the exams, the exams' time constraints were sometimes challenging to overcome.\nOverall, students found that APMA1170 was an extremely proof-oriented class. Former students wished that grading was more timely and that the TAs were better prepared. Otherwise, the general consensus was that the class was engaging and interesting, though not necessarily recommended for non-APMA concentrators. For shoppers, students recommend \"Operations Research\" (APMA1200), \"Computational Probability and Statistics\" (APMA1690), and \"Information Theory\" (APMA1710).\n\ninstructor: Instructors\nDohyun Kim\ndohyun_kim@brown.edu\n\nschedule: Schedule and Location\nMWF 9am-9:50am in Salomon Center 003\n\naverage_hours: 5.83\n\nmax_hours: 9.96\n\ncourse_rating: 61%\n3.78\n\nprofessor_rating: 82%\n4.62\n\nprofessor_and_term: APMA 1170 | Guzman, Johnny (S1) | Fall 2018\n\n", "code: APMA 1180\n\nterm: Spring 2025\n\ntitle: Introduction to Numerical Solution of Differential Equations\n\ndescription: \"Introduction to Numerical Solution of Differential Equations\" is a computationally heavy course offering students a different approach to finding the solutions of differential equations. Unlike the introductory differential equations APMA0330 and APMA0340, this course stresses the use of platforms such as MATLAB to find solution curves/surfaces. As such, students found that, in addition to the aforementioned courses, a background in a computational class such as APMA0160 or APMA1170, was useful.\nResponses to Professor Guzman's performance were generally positive. Students felt that he was genuinely interested in teaching, which led to a general openness towards students and their needs. Criticisms, however, included Professor Guzman sometimes stressing simple concepts over the more difficult ones, which caused students to be confused about what material was actually more important. Furthermore, one reviewer noted that the professor was a very hard grader who was \"very picky\" about details and felt that it was worth warning future students about this beforehand.\nCourse work consisted of five problem sets, a take home midterm, and final exam. All of the work focused on a blend of coding done in MATLAB and some analysis problems. There were no required readings in this course. Altogether, students felt that the work load was either on par with or below expectations.\nAll of the respondents recommended this class, with a few noting that it was especially pertinent for engineers and possibly less so for the theoretical mathematicians out there. However, almost all of the students warned that solid discipline (and perhaps some composure) was needed to survive the course. Although the work load was relatively light, the tough grading standards of Professor Guzman still apparently made for some difficult times for the class respondents.\n\ninstructor: Instructors\nPeter Sentz\npeter_sentz@brown.edu\n\nschedule: Schedule and Location\nMWF 1pm-1:50pm Location TBD\n\naverage_hours: N/A\n\nmax_hours: N/A\n\ncourse_rating: 70%\n4.35\n\nprofessor_rating: 80%\n4.52\n\nprofessor_and_term: APMA 1180 | Guzman, Johnny (S1) | Spring 2009\n\n", "code: APMA 1200\n\nterm: Spring 2025\n\ntitle: Operations Research: Probabilistic Models\n\ndescription: \"Operations Research: Probabilistic Models\" (APMA1200) covers basic probabilistic problems and methods in operations research and management science.

Prerequisites include \"Statistical Inference I\"(APMA1650) or its equivalents \"Statistical Inference I\"(APMA1655) and \"Probability\" (MATH1610). Almost all students noted the importance of these prerequisites toward APMA1200.\nProfessor Anastasios Matzavinos was noted for being a passionate and approachable lecturer. While his style was noted as very technical in the sense of being proof-heavy, students noted that the professor was generally very clear. Some students wished for more examples, and cited being lost as a result of a lack thereof, as well as the lack of lecture notes/capture. Most students reported that the professor was respondent via email, although sometimes office hours were canceled.\nCourse assignments include five practice sets, and one take-home midterm and final. Most respondents did not note these assignments as overly difficult and stated that they were relevant to course aims. Even for those who considered the coursework to be difficult, much help was provided by Professor Matzavinos in class in the form of hints and also by the TAs.\nThe consensus was that most reviewers praised APMA1200 for a relatively unique lecture style, but many noted that the focus could be set more on applications instead of pure theory.

Reviewers observed that the course was more application-based than theoretical. \u201cDeterministic Models\u201d was not a \u201chuge\u201d time commitment and had a workload that felt accessible to non-concentrators unfamiliar with higher-level mathematical concepts.\nOverall, reviewers praised Professor Culiac as \u201ca wonderful lecturer.\u201d Students highly recommended the course to concentrators and non-concentrators alike. \u201cDeterministic Models\u201d was a well-structured introduction that balanced \u201cpractical\u201d material as well as exploration into more complex mathematical concepts.\n\ninstructor: Instructors\nAmalia Culiuc\namalia_culiuc@brown.edu\n\nschedule: Schedule and Location\nTTh 10:30am-11:50am in Barus & Holley 166\n\naverage_hours: 3.40\n\nmax_hours: 6.17\n\ncourse_rating: 64%\n3.98\n\nprofessor_rating: 87%\n4.87\n\nprofessor_and_term: APMA 1210 | Culiuc, Amalia (S1) | Fall 2023\n\n", "code: APMA 1330\n\nterm: Fall 2024\n\ntitle: Applied Partial Differential Equations II\n\ndescription: \u201cMethods of Applied Mathematics\u201d (APMA1330), taught by Professor Stuart Geman, is a course that seeks to teach various methods of applied mathematics and form connections across disciplines within the field. Students seemed to come into this course with varying backgrounds because there were no official prerequisites for the course. Despite the fact that there were no official prerequisites, most students had taken other APMA courses and stated that having prior experience with probability, linear algebra, and differential equations was helpful.\nRespondents had high praise for Professor Geman, with one student saying he was \u201cthe most brilliant professor I\u2019ve ever had.\u201d Students found Professor Geman\u2019s teaching style, which consisted of lectures that alternated between theoretical and applied mathematics, to be effective and engaging. Respondents also appreciated that Professor Geman posted typed lecture notes after class, though one student wished that the lecture notes were corrected more frequently when mistakes appeared. In addition, reviewers agreed that Professor Geman was very available through office hours or via appointment and that he gave good feedback during his office hours.\nAssignments for this course consist of weekly homework assignments, one midterm exam, and a final exam. Generally, students thought the assignments were relevant to the course goals and helped them learn the material. Reviewers thought the assignments had varying levels of difficulty depending on their previous background in applied math, but these reviewers also stated that Professor Geman would lead them through difficult problems during office hours.\nOverall, students enjoyed Professor Geman and appreciated his passion for the course material. Many agreed that he devised an intelligent curriculum where he covered many topics and gave students a good understanding of the connectedness of different mathematical fields. In terms of improvements, some students suggested that more material should be covered and that the description of the course should be changed to better reflect the scope of the class. A suggestion that many reviewers had for potential students was to shop multiple professors because instructors have different approaches to teaching this course. Lastly, respondents stated that those who are interested in this course should also shop \u201cComputational Probability and Statistics\u201d (APMA1740), and \u201cRecent Applications of Probability and Statistics\u201d (APMA1690), both of which are also usually taught by Professor Geman.\n\ninstructor: Instructors\nZhuolun Yang\nzhuolun_yang@brown.edu\n\nschedule: Schedule and Location\nTTh 9am-10:20am in 101 Thayer Street (VGQ 1st fl) 116A\n\naverage_hours: 4.80\n\nmax_hours: 10.30\n\ncourse_rating: 73%\n4.53\n\nprofessor_rating: 86%\n4.82\n\nprofessor_and_term: APMA 1330 | Geman, Stuart (S1) | Fall 2019\n\n", "code: APMA 1360\n\nterm: Spring 2025\n\ntitle: Applied Dynamical Systems\n\ndescription: \"Topics in Chaotic Dynamics\" (APMA1360) is an upper-division applied math and WRIT course that aims to study the theory and application of dynamical systems: systems which exhibit a wide range of disparate behaviors depending on slightly different initial conditions.

A few students stated that a background in \"Analysis: Functions of One Variable\" (MATH1010) is also helpful (but by no means necessary) to understand some proofs.\nProfessor Bjorn Sandstede was unanimously described as an amazing and passionate teacher. He received positive comments on his clear board drawings to aid visual understanding as well as his posting of color-coded lecture notes after each class. In addition, his efficient use of Canvas and his availability on Piazza were major pluses for students. Professor Sandstede was always willing to make time for students and was readily available via email. Occasionally there could be some difficulty in arranging a specific time to meet outside of office hours.\nOutside class, work consisted of ten homework sets, two writing assignments, two midterms and a final project. Assignments could be difficult but were generally doable with group collaboration; one student described them as \"difficult and interesting, but not frustrating\". They were always relevant to course goals. Problem sets were graded in an extremely quick and timely fashion, and extensive feedback accompanied every grade - exams were treated similarly, and were regarded as about the same difficulty level as homework. Class members also noted that Professor Sandstede was very receptive to students' needs and understanding about extenuating circumstances students might be in.\nAll in all, nearly every student recommended this course as a great introduction to the exciting field of chaotic dynamics.

Additionally, some commented that general foreign language experience was helpful, with one writing that a background in Latin was \"very useful.\"\nStudents uniformly found Professor El-Sharkawi to be effective and engaging. Students felt that, like most successful instructors of foreign language, he made a significant effort to encourage class participation. In fact, one student reported that speaking in class was essentially required, explaining that, if you are not participating in the discussions, \"he'll make sure you do.\" Students felt that they benefited from this style and praised Professor El-Sharkawi's blend of encouragement and patience, as well as his \"many, many office hours.\"\nStudents called the class's demands reasonable and relevant. Though homework was assigned daily, students did not find this to be an excessive burden because the assignments reinforced the material from class and were graded for completion. There was one quiz or test every several weeks, complemented by one project in the form of a presentation to the class. Class sentiment on the assessments was positive. One student felt that going over the homework assignments more in class would have been helpful, though.\nOn average, students estimated spending approximately 10 hours per week on the course. Students' primary quibble with the structure of the class was with the timeliness of grading: They felt that handing back quizzes and homework assignments sooner would have helped.

There are no official prerequisites. Students found some prior knowledge of art history and archaeology to be helpful, but not necessary.\nOpinions of Professor Becker were mixed. Becker was noted to be an effective and succinct lecturer, using PowerPoint presentations to explain the material in-depth; however, some students found his style to be dry and monotone. A common complaint was that the professor did not encourage participation very often in class, only occasionally bringing up a question for discussion. Students noted that he was available outside of class during office hours and by appointment; however, some found him to be standoffish and difficult to approach.\nWork for this class consisted of multiple assigned readings, two papers, two quizzes, two midterms, and a final exam. The readings were generally well-liked and regarded as helpful, though some of them were apparently dry and technical. Despite the large amount of reading required, some students found that the material that overlapped with information given during lecture was superfluous and, therefore, unnecessary.\nStudents generally spent between four and ten hours a week on this course, though a few people spent much more time. Overall, students felt that the professor vastly over-exaggerated the amount of material they needed to know for his exams. Another common suggestion was to post the PowerPoints online due to the bountiful presence of graphics that they needed to digest. Suggested co-courses were ARCH0100 and other art history courses, due to the commonalities between the subjects.

There are no prerequisites; students generally agreed that an interest in the subject was enough to succeed in the class, though some prior coursework in archaeology might be helpful in understanding the material.\nARCH0100 was led by by Professors Parker Van Valkenburgh and Laurel Bestock. Both professors were described by respondents as passionate and engaging lecturers who combined archaeology and anthropology in a way that was accessible for a foundation-level course. One class member especially appreciated the way that they integrated stories into their lectures to keep students interested, and praised their knowledge of the subject material.\nAssignments for the course consisted of readings for each class, weekly labs, and three papers. Though brainstorming and planning were done in a group for each paper, they were written individually. Labs were praised by one student as \"the highlight of the class,\" as they provided engaging and accessible hands-on experience. Class members generally agreed that the readings were both useful and relevant to gain background information on the lecture topics. On average, students spent about five hours per week on this class.\nOverall, respondents found that the professors' passion and engaging teaching styles made \u201cField Archaeology in the Ancient World\u201d a fun and worthwhile class.

As archaeologists have become more cautious about excavation, technological developments have transformed our ability to detect the past. We can now analyze entire settlements through the aid of drones, spy satellites, magnetometers, and ground penetrating radar. Yet such technologies come at a social and ethical cost \u2013 particularly pertaining to indigenous rights, private property, and mass surveillance.

Why not study the archaeology behind our beloved home? \u201cThe Archaeology of College Hill\u201d (ARCH1900) is a course taught by Professor Alex Marko covering hands-on instruction in the field of archaeology. Students are taught methods used by professionals and practice these skills in the area. Reviewers reported that a general knowledge in the history of Providence and in the field of archaeology went far in this course, but no formal background was necessary to be successful in this course.\nThis course was a largely interactive seminar style class with some lectures. Professor Marko was described as greatly successful in his teaching and very interactive. Passion for the field and topics fueled this course, and to much success. The professor was very available to students, and responded rather quickly when called upon outside of class. The feedback on the course work was available and constructive to improve students\u2019 future works. Overall, casual and comfortable interactions were the status quo in the classroom.\nCourse work included weekly responses, site reports/field journal, a midterm paper, and a final project/paper. Assignments were of moderate difficulty but were as expected at the beginning of the semester.\nEnthusiasm was not lacking on either end of the course\u2014the professor and the TA both surprised students with Halloween costumes. A general wish for more time hands on in the field was expressed, as well as an overview of the background of the field of archaeology. Reviewers recommended interested students shop Urban Studies courses, other Archaeology courses, History courses, and similarly designed courses.\n\ninstructor: Instructors\nCandace Rice\ncandace_rice@brown.edu\nLeah Neiman\nleah_neiman@brown.edu\n\nschedule: Schedule and Location\nW 3pm-5:30pm in Rhode Island Hall 108\n\nprograms: Curricular Programs\nCommunity-Based Learning and Research (CBLR)\nWriting - Designated Courses (WRIT)\n\naverage_hours: 3.17\n\nmax_hours: 7.82\n\ncourse_rating: 71%\n4.41\n\nprofessor_rating: 87%\n4.85\n\nprofessor_and_term: ARCH 1900 | Marko, Alex (S1) | Fall 2019\n\n", "code: ARCH 2184\n\nterm: Fall 2024\n\ntitle: Material Culture and the Bodily Senses: Past and Present\n\ndescription: How do the senses shape our experience?

The class has no required prerequisites, but students mentioned that high school world history was slightly helpful. Most students had no prior knowledge of the course subject.\nThe class included weekly lectures and student-led discussion section. Students noted that lectures included PowerPoint presentations which they felt were extremely effective, informative, and straightforward. However, they thought that the student-led discussions were too repetitive of lecture topics, and at times long and dry. Reviewers stated that Professor Steele had multiple office hours throughout the week and was very easy to contact. The instructor was reporting as giving prompt and useful feedback to the students and was very enthusiastic about the course material.\nThe course consisted of weekly readings of 100 to 200 pages, along with student presentations every third week. Additionally, there were three 1000-word essays and the final included a 3000-word essay with a research presentation. Many noted that the readings were extremely repetitive of each other and of lecture, but were not difficult to understand. Overall, students felt that the workload was very manageable and did not feel overwhelmed by the course.\nMost of the students enjoyed the class because of the unique topics ranging from ancient to modern Babylon. The material covered not only history, but also the science, religion, politics, and literature of Babylon. Some felt that readings should be more diversified in terms of material and media. Shoppers should be aware that the \u201cMyth\u201d portion of the course is not Babylonian myths but refers to clarifying modern misconceptions of Babylonian culture.

There are no prerequisites for this class, but some reviewers mentioned that previous language study, whether it be in high school or college, was useful. Knowledge of the ancient world, specifically Mesopotamia, was also helpful in contextualizing the language.\nStudents described Dr. Matthew Glassman as an effective lecturer who taught straight from the textbook. Respondents appreciated his laid-back teaching style, which made the Akkadian language extremely approachable. Reviewers noted that he was easily accessible by email but was unable to meet in person due to lacking an office on Brown\u2019s campus. Students found his feedback very helpful.\nThe coursework consisted of four exams and weekly homework assignments. Students found the assignments to be very relevant to class goals but thought that they could be time-consuming. Some wished for additional homework, feeling that more practice would have helped them understand the material. Overall, though, the homework was helpful in preparation for the course; respondents noted that it was necessary for success.\nClass members found this opportunity to learn a new ancient language extremely worthwhile. Most reviewers wished for a greater introduction to linguistic terminology present in the Akkadian textbook and hoped for additional reading practice. Respondents emphasized that learning an ancient language, especially Akkadian, can be intensive, and that it requires time and effort outside of the classroom.

Well over a thousand years before the Persian Empire, Hammurabi of Babylon engaged in a project of statecraft that reshaped the political landscape of ancient Iraq, and the fall of Babylon a few generations later presaged an expansive international age that reached from north Africa and the eastern Mediterranean across Iraq and into Iran.

The graded assignments in this course consisted of two exams and one final project, along with occasional short quizzes, all of which were met with few complaints.\nThe amount of work students spent on this class generally ranged between two and five hours a week, which matched the expectations of some but was actually less work than some students had initially expected. This course came recommended to students interested in biotechnology or just science and business in general, and \"Biotechnology in Medicine\", or BIOL 0170, also came recommended to students interested in the material of this course.\n\ninstructor: Instructors\nBarrett Bready\nbarrett_bready@brown.edu\n\nschedule: Schedule and Location\nT 4pm-6:30pm Location TBD\n\naverage_hours: N/A\n\nmax_hours: N/A\n\ncourse_rating: 61%\n4.55\n\nprofessor_rating: 80%\n4.49\n\nprofessor_and_term: BIOL 0080 | Bready, Barrett (S1) | Spring 2009\n\n", "code: BIOL 0100\n\nterm: Spring 2025\n\ntitle: Living Biology at Brown and Beyond\n\ndescription: \u201cLiving Biology at Brown and Beyond\u201d (BIOL0100) is a freshman seminar designed to acclimate students to Brown\u2019s biology concentration by introducing a range of microbiological laboratory skills, as well as through practice reading and writing STEM literature. The course is suited for those with minimal experience in biology, with students agreeing that, at most, high school biology prepared them for this course.\nIn Fall 2022, this course was co-taught by Professors Kristina Monteiro and Jody Hall. Professor Monteiro taught the discussion portion of the course, while Professor Hall taught the lab portion. Both professors were praised for being \u201creadily available outside of class,\u201d as well as for being open to questions during class. Professor Monteiro was applauded for the breadth of material that she presented about \u201cbiology, statistics, and pre-med tracks,\u201d and Professor Hall was applauded for making lab instructions very clear, as well as for staying late when labs ran longer than expected.\nThe course had six labs and readings, ten discussion posts, two outside-of-class quizzes, and three papers. The amount of reading for class was described as a lot, \u201cbut\u2026 not impossible.\u201d The readings were discussed in class weekly and also called for written responses. The lab portion of the class was reported to be \u201chands off,\u201d but with Professor Hall close by and very willing to help as needed. There was no final exam for the class.\nOverall the course was viewed very positively by students, with the most exciting part being an end-of-year field trip to a greenhouse. While course work was consistent, it was not overwhelming, and the professors assigned noticeably less during finals period in recognition of other classes. Students noted that the key to doing well in the class was to complete the work.\n\ninstructor: Instructors\nKristina Monteiro\nkristina_monteiro@brown.edu\nJody Hall\njody_hall@brown.edu\n\nschedule: Schedule and Location\nW 3pm-5:30pm Location TBD\n\nprograms: Curricular Programs\nFirst Year Seminar (FYS)\n\naverage_hours: 2.67\n\nmax_hours: 4.67\n\ncourse_rating: 59%\n3.70\n\nprofessor_rating: 75%\n4.72\n\nprofessor_and_term: BIOL 0100 | Monteiro, Kristina (S1) | Fall 2022\n\n", "code: BIOL 0170\n\nterm: Fall 2024\n\ntitle: Biotechnology in Medicine\n\ndescription: \u201cBiotechnology in Medicine\u201d (BIOL0170) aims to introduce students to the major technological advances in medicine.

There are no prerequisites for this class; students noted that although background knowledge of current events in biology or introductory knowledge of biological systems was useful, it was not absolutely necessary for their success in the course.\nProfessor Toni-Marie Achilli was praised by respondents as an amazing lecturer, with organised and clear slideshows as well as engaging presentations. She was an effective facilitator of discussions and encouraged students to always ask questions and critically analyze what they learned. She was additionally commended for her passion, experience, and generous accommodation of student needs. Professor Achille held frequent office hours and reviewers appreciated her always welcoming persona. Though some students noted her lectures to be a little fast-paced, her easily digestible and clear slideshows as well as lecture capture usage allowed students to stay on track.\nAssignments included weekly readings and quizzes, two papers, and three in-class exams. Although exams were open note, students still noted them to be a time crunch. Weekly quizzes were submitted through canvas and readings covered a variety of topics, including organ replacement, tissue engineering, stem cells, and pharmaceutical development. The readings were noted to be \u201chit or miss\u201d in regard to their effectiveness towards a student\u2019s overall understanding of course material. The overall workload was noted to be relatively light.\nOverall, students greatly enjoyed this course and its multidimensional study of biotechnology. One student noted it to be a great introduction to the complex nature of biotechnology, and that it would be a very fascinating class no matter one's concentration or background.

A primary focus of the course is Charles Darwin and his theory of Natural Selection. There are no official prerequisites for the course, as students noted that the course was designed to be accessible to students of all academic backgrounds. However, class members agreed that a basic background and interest in biology was useful.\nStudents universally praised Professor Stephen Helfand for his depth of knowledge and enjoyed the laid back discussions that primarily filled classes. Students were especially appreciative of Professor Helfand\u2019s passion, sense of humor, and \u201cunique life advice.\u201d Students welcomed Professor Helfand\u2019s insights, which guided discussions through intriguing and enlightening points of topics. Several students noted that some class members rarely spoke and suggested that the instructor take on a more active role in leading discussions. Professor Helfand did not hold regular office hours, but students agreed that his availability through email and appointments was more than sufficient.\nThe course assignments consisted of weekly readings, one presentation, and one final paper. Students were also expected to lead two class discussions with a partner. Students characterized the pace of the course as low-pressure. One student stated an appreciation for the focus of promoting \u201clearning rather than memorization\u201d; most agreed that the assignments successfully facilitated a thorough understanding of the concepts addressed in the readings and in class discussions.\nAll in all, students overwhelmingly agreed that the course was highly worthwhile as an opportunity to explore a subject underlying the content of other scientific courses while experiencing Professor Helfand\u2019s unique wit and insight.

Students will also learn about DNA isolation, purification, and restriction mapping through rigorous and immersive laboratory work. There are no prerequisites, though several respondents mentioned AP Biology and AP Chemistry as being helpful in understanding the material.\nBIOL01904 was taught by Professor Sarah Taylor. Professor Taylor was praised by her students for being extremely passionate and knowledgeable about the material; one class member described her as a \"pure force of nature.\" Respondents appreciated her understanding of student needs, her openness to suggestions, and her dedication to making sure that students were succeeding while also giving them the space to learn and practice the material for themselves. Students also enjoyed her lecture style and her well-prepared materials. However, some found that maintaining focus could be difficult during the two-and-a-half hour lecture period, especially since the lecture material was not always relevant for lab work, and suggested having shorter lectures twice a week.\nAssignments for the course consisted of two short homework assignments, weekly lab every week, and a final presentation on each person's phage. Students noted that though there was little work outside of class and lab, Laboratory work was a significant time commitment; several remarked that they put in extra lab hours to make things work. A note to potential shoppers: this year, the final exam was replaced with a large homework assignment, but this is unlikely to be true in the future.\nOverall, respondents greatly enjoyed this course for its extreme flexibility and the unique skills it taught. Potential class members are advised to stay on top of their lab notebooks, to take advantage of the small class size and meet new people, and to keep in mind that as they will be learning a new skill set.

In this semester, students annotated the genome of viruses isolated earlier in the year. Reviewers noted that most of the skills that aided this segment were learned in the first semester (BIOL0190R).\nProfessor Yang Zhou, Professor Christopher de Graffenried, and Sarah Taylor, instructional coordinator/science learning specialist, taught the course and were described as passionate and knowledgeable about the subject matter. The class was mostly dominated by small-group discussion rather than lecture. All of the professors emphasized individual ambition, and encouraged students to take on independent study projects. Feedback was generally clear and concise, although some reviewers noted that they wished more specific advice had been available in some instances. As a whole, students reported that all three professors were approachable and offered straightforward feedback when requested by students.\nAssignments included weekly journal readings with occasional presentations of these articles. The class worked together to annotate the genome of a few selected viruses over the entire semester. In addition, this class included a midterm. Homework was described as very relevant to the work students conducted in lab and section, and reviewers noted that the heavy in-class workload annotating phage genomes was rewarding because students were directly contributing to the repository of scientific knowledge.\nReviewers recommended this class to anyone interested in the life sciences or research. This sequence, while lasting a full year, was noted to be unique in its opportunity to offer real contribution to the scientific world and to bond closely with faculty and other students. Reviewers described this course as \u201cone of a kind,\u201d and noted that it helped prepare them for other classes in the department.\n\ninstructor: Instructors\nSarah Taylor\nsarah_taylor@brown.edu\nYang Zhou\nyang_zhou@brown.edu\n\nschedule: Schedule and Location\nTTh 4pm-6:30pm Location TBD\n\nprograms: Curricular Programs\nCollaborative Scholarly Experiences (COEX)\nFirst Year Seminar (FYS)\n\naverage_hours: 1.94\n\nmax_hours: 7.18\n\ncourse_rating: 66%\n4.08\n\nprofessor_rating: 79%\n4.44\n\nprofessor_and_term: BIOL 0190S | de Graffenried, Christopher (S1) | Spring 2016\n\n", "code: BIOL 0200\n\nterm: Fall 2024\n\ntitle: The Foundation of Living Systems\n\ndescription: \u201cThe Foundation of Living Systems\u201d (BIOL0200) provides a broad introduction to biological systems, covering fundamentals of biochemistry, molecular, and cellular biology, as well as ecology, evolution, and development. There are no prerequisites, and students agreed that high school biology classes prepared them adequately for this course.\nThis class was lecture-based, with lectures split between Professor Bill Holmes and Professor John Stein. Reviewers overwhelmingly agreed that lectures were engaging but content-dense. They were structured largely around slides, which served as an important reference for exams. Respondents specifically noted that Professor Holmes\u2019 lectures were well-organized and clear. Some students mentioned that Professor Stein sometimes strayed from his slides to provide more verbal elaboration, which made lectures somewhat harder to follow. Reviewers also felt that office hours were very welcoming and accessible, and useful even for students who did not have specific questions.\nCoursework consisted of pre-lecture readings and quizzes for every class, weekly problem sets, weekly labs, four midterms, and a final. Respondents had mixed feelings about how useful the readings were; some felt they were necessary to keep up with the class, while others believed they were unnecessary. Quizzes and problem sets were generally short and straightforward, with quizzes allowing unlimited attempts. Though labs were weekly, they did not include lab reports. Exams were generally described as challenging and requiring significant amounts of review - many reviewers strongly recommended students without a background in biology or chemistry attend review sessions and sign up for Sheridan Center tutoring.\nAs a whole, reviewers found BIOL0200 to be a fast-paced but engaging introductory course in biology, with very supportive instructors. Students who have not taken AP Biology but are looking to build a solid foundation in biology, and fill prerequisites for intermediate biology courses are a good fit for this course.\n\ninstructor: Instructors\nWilliam Holmes\nwilliam_holmes@brown.edu\nJohn Stein\njohn_j_stein@brown.edu\n\nschedule: Schedule and Location\nMWF 9am-9:50am in Salomon Center 001\n\naverage_hours: 4.46\n\nmax_hours: 13.91\n\ncourse_rating: 67%\n4.20\n\nprofessor_rating: 83%\n4.67\n\nprofessor_and_term: BIOL 0200 | Holmes, William (S1) | Fall 2023\n\n", "code: BIOL 0210\n\nterm: Fall 2024\n\ntitle: Diversity of Life\n\ndescription: Taught by Professor James Kellner, \"Diversity of Life\" (BIOL0210) explores biological diversity \u2013 the number of taxa and the functions and processes that support life \u2013 from the perspectives of ecology and evolutionary biology.

There are no prerequisites for this course. Some class members said that AP Biology in high school or other college-level courses were helpful in understanding the material, but were by no means necessary to succeed.\nProfessor Kellner was universally lauded by respondents for his engaging, clear, and passionate lecturing style; several described his lectures as being similar to TED Talks. Students enjoyed the graphics and videos he used in lectures, as well as his clear, concise explanations of complicated scientific theories. Others particularly appreciated the way he used lecture time effectively, his activity on the course Slack page, and how he encouraged students to think about the material rather than merely memorizing content for an exam. Class members also noted that he was very receptive to students' needs and changing circumstances, and was available to meet after class and in office hours to answer questions. One respondent wrote that above all, Professor Kellner \"cares about what he is teaching and cares about the students he is teaching to.\"\nAssignments for the course consisted of four in-class exams and optional weekly readings. Only material covered in lectures was on exams. The lowest exam score was dropped at the end of the semester.\nOverall, students greatly enjoyed this course. One class member wrote that this was \" the first course at Brown where I felt like I was genuinely focused more on learning\" rather than just getting a good grade; another wrote that even though they did not think that the class would be of any interest to them, it was the best course they had ever taken in their four years at Brown.

In addition, some background in biology, whether it was AP Biology or biology at Brown, was essential for understanding how to study the material.\nThe class was taught jointly by Professor George Lisi, Professors Arthur Salomon, and Professors Alexandra Deaconescu. Respondents consistently said that each professor explained the material very thoroughly and clearly, but it was difficult to determine which concept was important. They also noted that the teaching is divided in a way that made it harder to get acclimated to anyone's teaching style and to keep up with the materials.\nCourse requirements consisted of four non-cumulative exams, nine homework assignments (the lowest two were dropped), and a short project. There was agreement among reviewers that the workload was relatively time-consuming, and that while the exams weren\u2019t cumulative, the sheer volume of material required consistent studying. Many also stated that the exams were particularly memorization-heavy, and the online platform used for homework was difficult to navigate.\nOverall, students felt that BIOL0280 was intensive but worthwhile.

Official prerequisites include BIOL0200/0210 or equivalent, but a few respondents noted that they found BIOL0420 and BIOL0470 helpful as well. Students emphasized that while the biology prerequisite was important, they felt that the class was approachable for non-concentrators or those with limited experience in the subject.\nRespondents lauded Professor Daniel Weinreich for his interesting and well-structured slides and notes. While classes were primarily lecture-based, reviewers emphasized that Professor Weinreich was highly responsive to questions both in class and during office hours. Praised as highly passionate, approachable, and kind, reviewers unanimously asserted that Professor Weinreich was able to articulate complex topics clearly and directly in a way that made concepts accessible to those with a weaker biological background. Several respondents noted that the professor went out of his way to build relationships with students in class and during office hours, learning names and being especially responsive to questions or feedback over email.\nAssignments for BIOL0380 included around 50 readings consisting of short papers, problem sets for each unit, post-lecture quizzes, a long-term group project, a midterm, and a final exam. Students found the assigned readings interesting but not always necessary, as most of the content necessary was typically covered during lectures. Many felt the post-lecture quizzes weren\u2019t very helpful for their understanding of topics, and tended to be a bit frustrating. While each lecture was recorded, attendance was expected and thus recordings were available only upon request or directly in advance of an exam, which some respondents found to be a drawback. Generally, students felt that the course generally moved rather quickly and recommended staying up-to-date on all assignments to avoid feeling overwhelmed before each exam.\nOverall, all reviewers thoroughly enjoyed BIOL0380 and recommended anyone with an interest in the material regardless of concentration to shop it. Especially in the context of recent years, many found the content more relevant than ever, strongly recommending the course due to its excellent professor and topical subject matter.

This matched their expectations. Most people recommended taking the class.\n\ninstructor: Instructors\nJon Witman\njon_witman@brown.edu\n\nschedule: Schedule and Location\nTTh 9am-10:20am Location TBD\n\naverage_hours: N/A\n\nmax_hours: N/A\n\ncourse_rating: 49%\n4.28\n\nprofessor_rating: 63%\n4.24\n\nprofessor_and_term: BIOL 0420 | Witman, Jon (S1) | Spring 2006\n\n", "code: BIOL 0430\n\nterm: Spring 2025\n\ntitle: The Evolution of Plant Diversity\n\ndescription: \u201cThe Evolution of Plant Diversity\u201d (BIOL0430) is a course that takes on a phylogenetic perspective to examine the evolutionary history of plants. This course has no required prerequisites, but introductory biology courses were considered useful background information by many respondents.\nProfessor Rebecca Kartzinel was described as highly knowledgeable, passionate, and understanding. She was receptive to questions and feedback both during class and after. Students felt lectures were useful and full of information. Professor Kartzinel did typically lecture based on slides but \u201cadded good anecdotes and added interesting videos.\u201d All lectures were recorded, but students noted that in-person was most valuable. Overall, most students felt that lectures were both effective and worthwhile.\nThis course consists of both a regular lecture hour and a lab component. Student opinions of the required readings were mixed. Some respondents said that they were useful, while others felt that they were not necessary. Course assignments include weekly readings, occasional reading assignments, a couple of quizzes, three exams, and one final project. There are also several extra credit opportunities. According to reviewers, a typical work week was anywhere from one to six hours, though some weeks could range from 6 to 12 hours.\nThe majority of reviewers expressed that they enjoyed this course and Professor Kartzinel's instruction. Many students noted that memorization is a major aspect of this course. Finally, some students expressed that the course was great for students of all concentrations. In the words of one student, \"The class has a lot of non-bio concentrators, which is nice if you're looking for a lab science course that doesn't have that intense vibe.\u201d\n\ninstructor: Instructors\nRebecca Kartzinel\nrebecca_kartzinel@brown.edu\n\nschedule: Schedule and Location\nTTh 9am-10:20am Location TBD\n\naverage_hours: 2.86\n\nmax_hours: 8.57\n\ncourse_rating: 70%\n4.34\n\nprofessor_rating: 80%\n4.69\n\nprofessor_and_term: BIOL 0430 | Kartzinel, Rebecca (S1) | Spring 2022\n\n", "code: BIOL 0440\n\nterm: Spring 2025\n\ntitle: Inquiry in Plant Biology: Analysis of Plant Growth, Reproduction and Adaptive Responses\n\ndescription: 'Plant Organisms' will, quite obviously, teach you everything you wanted to know about the structure,function, and evolution of plants The great thing is that the only prerequisite for this course is the knowledge of what a plant is.\nProfessor Holowinsky's teaching style was appreciated by the students, who felt that he treated them with a great deal of respect. He was clearly enthusiastic about the class, but he lacked organization, which at times detracted from his teaching ability. Although his lectures were not exactly riveting, he was always willing to answer questions and was eager to teach.\nThe grade for this class was determined from two take-home midterms, a take-home final, and a graded lab notebook. There were also weekly readings, which some reviewers felt were unnecessary. Many felt that there was an excessive amount of work at the end of the class and would have appreciated it being more spread out over the course of the semester. People spent an average of five hours per week on this course. Reading period was not observed.\nIf you know you have no interest in plants, by all means, stay away and fulfill your biology concentration requirement elsewhere.

Students also noted that previous experience working in a research lab prepared them for understanding conceptually difficult topics.\nProfessor Robert Reenan, Professor Mark Johnson, and Professor Erica Larschan taught the beginning, middle, and final sections of the course, respectively. Opinions on the three lecturers were mixed. Students reflected that Professor Reenan went through content too quickly. His presentations were very content-heavy but were often difficult to interpret. Many students stated that these beginning lectures required \u201cgoing back through it to understand\u201d. Professor Johnson went in depth in his teaching and went at an appropriate pace. He was described as very responsive to student questions and open to discussing content after class. Professor Larschan was described as very passionate about the content, and this made her lectures very engaging. Students noted that her use of current research developments to accompany the concepts she presents was often helpful and praised her lecturing style.\nIn addition to weekly lectures, the course consisted of weekly discussion sections and a weekly lab section. There were nine homework assignments, four take-home exams, optional weekly readings, and occasionally lab assignments. On average, students spent four to six hours on this class outside of lectures, however, some students reported spending over ten hours working during certain weeks. Almost all the students emphasized that TA clinic sessions were essential in completing the weekly problem sets. A small number of students did note, however, that waiting in the clinic queue for hours left them extremely frustrated and was not beneficial to their learning. Many students also found that poor wording on exams and problem sets could often lead to unnecessary confusion and felt like their scores did not reflect their comprehension of the topics.\nOverall, the majority of responders endorsed the difficulty of this course and several respondents advised against taking the course unless to fulfill a concentration requirement. This is a very \u201capply-heavy\u201d course, and completing assigned homework is essential to facilitate understanding. Students also noted that office hours and clinics were important for high achievement in the course. One respondent advised future students to \u201cregularly attend office hours, go to clinic every week (for many hours), and find a good group of people to do [problem sets] with\" to be successful in the course.\n\ninstructor: Instructors\nMark Johnson\nmark_johnson_1@brown.edu\nErica Larschan\nerica_larschan@brown.edu\nJody Hall\njody_hall@brown.edu\nRobert Reenan\nrobert_reenan@brown.edu\n\nschedule: Schedule and Location\nTTh 10:30am-11:50am in Salomon Center DECI\n\naverage_hours: 5.86\n\nmax_hours: 10.67\n\ncourse_rating: 50%\n3.35\n\nprofessor_rating: 63%\n3.71\n\nprofessor_and_term: BIOL 0470 | Johnson, Mark (S1) | Fall 2023\n\n", "code: BIOL 0480\n\nterm: Fall 2024\n\ntitle: Evolutionary Biology\n\ndescription: \u201cEvolutionary Biology\u201d (BIOL0480) is a course that provides a broad introduction to evolution at different levels of biological organization. Taught by Professor David Rand, the course covers topics such as natural selection, adaptation, speciation, systematics, mass extinction events, and human evolution. \u201cThe Foundation of Living Systems\u201d (BIOL0200), or an equivalent placement, is a prerequisite for the course. Many students found that AP Biology helped them prepare for this course.\nProfessor Rand was described as both very passionate and knowledgeable, with many students citing that his enthusiasm for the subject was primarily what kept them engaged throughout the course. However, respondents noted that lectures were often content-heavy, and the lecture slides could be dense and confusing, given that each was an overview of an incredibly broad topic. Some students wished Professor Rand had explained the examples he provided in class in greater detail, as his examples were often complicated, and it was sometimes difficult to determine which themes were most important.\nAlongside weekly discussion sections, the course consisted of weekly in-class quizzes, weekly textbook readings, three midterm exams, three problem sets (one before each midterm), and a take-home final. Many reviewers were satisfied with the number of midterms and the grading policy (which involved the lowest midterm grade being dropped), though one student found it frustrating that the final accounted for 40% of the class grade. Many students noted that Professor Rand\u2019s practice exams, alongside reviewing vocabulary discussed in class, were especially important for doing well and understanding course material.\nOverall, respondents found BIOL0480 enjoyable and engaging. They particularly highlighted Professor Rand\u2019s passion as well as the range of interesting topics he covered, making the course suitable for students of any concentration. However, they also acknowledged that the course required a large time commitment and that a decent amount of effort was needed to succeed and understand the course material.\n\ninstructor: Instructors\nDavid Rand\ndavid_rand@brown.edu\n\nschedule: Schedule and Location\nMWF 9am-9:50am in Smith-Buonanno Hall 106\n\nprograms: Curricular Programs\nAccessible to Remote Students (REM)\n\naverage_hours: 3.95\n\nmax_hours: 9.41\n\ncourse_rating: 63%\n3.88\n\nprofessor_rating: 82%\n4.58\n\nprofessor_and_term: BIOL 0480 | Rand, David (S1) | Fall 2023\n\n", "code: BIOL 0495\n\nterm: Spring 2025\n\ntitle: Statistical Analysis of Biological Data\n\ndescription: \u201cStatistical Analysis of Biological Data\u201d (BIOL0495) is an introductory course in probability and parametric statistics as well as data-centric computer science with an emphasis on biological data and concepts. The official prerequisites for the course are BIOL0200 and MATH0100, but many students believed that prior knowledge in statistics (AP Stats, APMA1650), coding (CSCI0150), and a decent biology and math background were all useful but not required for this course.\nProfessor Sohini Ramachandran was described as a very passionate and wonderful professor. The vast majority of her students enjoyed how she was easy to approach and knew every single one of their names, putting a heavy emphasis on wanting everybody to understand the content. She taught in a concise but quick manner, writing everything on a board so people could follow along more easily. Professor Ramachandran made students feel like statistics were interesting and tried to make it more relatable by using real-life examples such as the gender pay gap and police brutality which she would explain with great detail, making learning more effective. She was a fair and good lecturer that was always thought of as \u201csweet\u201d.\nBIOL0495 consisted of optional weekly readings that were thought to be interesting but not extremely useful. Weekly mandatory problem set \u201cquizzes\u201d, two in-person midterms, and then a final whose first part was taken in class with the second part as take-home was in the coding language of R. There were \u201clabs\u201d that went more in-depth with the R language so that students could learn it with more ease.\nOverall, there was a general positive trend in the responses to this course. Respondents thought that despite its challenging nature, especially with learning R and applying statistics to biology, they enjoyed the class and found it rewarding. Professor Ramachandran was deemed as a great professor that valued students and wanted them to learn with ease and made the content more interesting. Respondents did generally agree that to succeed, people need to have a general interest in biological statistics and be willing to put in the work, saying that if people just want to complete their statistical class requirement, there are easier classes to take.\n\ninstructor: Instructors\nSohini Ramachandran\nsohini_ramachandran@brown.edu\n\nschedule: Schedule and Location\nTTh 2:30pm-3:50pm Location TBD\n\naverage_hours: 5.50\n\nmax_hours: 10.38\n\ncourse_rating: 63%\n4.26\n\nprofessor_rating: 81%\n4.54\n\nprofessor_and_term: BIOL 0495 | Ramachandran, Sohini (S1) | Spring 2023\n\n", "code: BIOL 0500\n\nterm: Spring 2025\n\ntitle: Cell and Molecular Biology\n\ndescription: Want to peek behind the phospholipid membrane? \"Cell and Molecular Biology\" will let you. This course covered basic cellular processes and required BIOL0200 or the AP Biology equivalent, prerequisites that most students agreed to be appropriate. Some found background in genetics or chemistry helpful.\nTwo professors taught the course, both recognized as very knowledgeable. Professor Freiman was lauded for his tendency to explain rather than describe, ability to gauge class understanding, and good PowerPoint slides. On the other hand, Professor Atwood's slides were panned for being too dense with text and videos; many students noted that he tended to \"run through\" the slides without emphasizing the important points. Possibly a side-effect of the 8:30 am class time, the lecturers' dryness and lack of success in eliciting participation were noted by many. Finally, students found the professors' office hours inconvenient, located downtown and lasting for only an hour on Mondays and Wednesdays.\nAssessments consisted exclusively of three non-cumulative, equally-weighted exams: there was no final, and class ended about two weeks before reading period. Reviewers noted that the exams covered lots of material, some in great detail; they recommended that future students make use of review sessions and study the lecture slides well. Reviewers were divided on the textbook: some thought it was a great resource and found the movies on the CD useful; others thought it was unnecessary for success in the course. Participants enjoyed the primary papers assigned towards the end of the course, with some calling it their favorite part of the class.\nStudents wished for more concise lecture slides and exams that did not coincide with exams for CHEM0350, Organic Chemistry.

The course focuses on microbial significance for infectious disease, public health, genetics, biotechnology, and biogeochemical cycles. It is expected that students have either taken \"The Foundation of Living Systems\" (BIOL0200) or have an equivalent placement. During the Spring 2021 semester, enrollment excluded first-years, but the course will be open to all grade levels again in Spring 2022.\nRespondents applauded Professor Richard Bennett for encouraging students to ask questions, even if they didn\u2019t directly relate to the material. Professor Bennett was also described as very flexible and respectful with student concerns. Professor Bennett would occasionally run out of time during lectures, but students praised him for his ability to let his passions and hobbies shine through the lectures, which in turn allowed students to better understand, appreciate, and enjoy the course.\nAssignments for the course included one article reading per week, three non-cumulative exams, and one final short film assignment. Students noted that the exams were largely based on the lecture slides with a few application-based questions.\nRespondents emphasized that the course required a basic knowledge of chemistry and overlapped with some biochemistry teachings.

It\u2019s a foundational course for students pursuing the Immunobiology Track with no prerequisites other than BIOL0200. Many students had contrasting beliefs with some believing that no class could prepare you for the content of BIOL0530, since it is one of a kind in its material. However, many students believe that previous enrollment in a class in which memorization is key, such as BIOL0500, would be beneficial in developing skills in learning large amounts of information.\nProfessor Aisling Dugan was greatly loved by all her students. Many respondents felt the class structure resembled the friendly format of high school classes, despite being a large class with a lecture format. Professor Dugan would have a mini-review at the beginning of each lecture so that students could actively participate in recalling past content, and then with a lot of passion, would teach the full slides. There were a lot of visuals to the slides, and even though the slides were informative and generally clear, Professor Dugan would always add more information during class. She was described as informative, clear, engaging, and available. Students felt the only occasional problem was that for some lectures, she wasn\u2019t able to cover all of the slides because there was just too much information to cover.\nBIOL0530 consists of three non-cumulative in-class exams, all of which require students to memorize a large quantity of information, so it was advised to continuously study for this course, rather than cramming before an exam. In addition, there were three primary literature group assignments that were very useful in learning how to read and analyze scientific papers. There was an overall consensus that the course had very fair, nearly lenient grading, but to succeed in this class, students had to put in work to get results.\nOverall, this class required a lot of work but was considered worth it. Professor Dugan was admired for her passion and clarity. Most of the course was made up of exams, and it could be easy to fall behind. However, if students maintained the right mentality and work ethic, they would succeed. It was advised that all pre-medical students take BIOL0530, despite it not having a lab component because the course truly is useful and contains fascinating material.\n\ninstructor: Instructors\nAisling Dugan\naisling_dugan@brown.edu\n\nschedule: Schedule and Location\nTTh 2:30pm-3:50pm in 85 Waterman Street 130\n\naverage_hours: 5.22\n\nmax_hours: 11.44\n\ncourse_rating: 66%\n4.12\n\nprofessor_rating: 73%\n4.57\n\nprofessor_and_term: BIOL 0530 | Dugan, Aisling (S1) | Fall 2023\n\n", "code: BIOL 0610\n\nterm: Spring 2025\n\ntitle: Modeling Human Disease Using Stem Cells\n\ndescription: In this COEX course, students will have the opportunity to develop their own hypothesis-driven research question with a focus on pluripotent stem cell biology.

However, a few felt he could sometimes be unapparoachable, and several complained that grading could be slow and inconsistent. The course was conducted asynchronously, with lectures prerecorded and then posted online, which many reviewers felt was not the most effective way to learn the material. Several students also noted that lectures were often posted later than the expected date, but with associated assignments still due at the scheduled time, which they felt was unfair.\nCoursework consisted of nine quizzes, five labs, and three take-home exams. Most respondents felt that the quizzes and exams were difficult but manageable, although they warned that studying was important (even though the exams were open book). The exams were heavily application-based, and students noted that it was important to have a thorough understanding of the material, as rote memorization would not be sufficient preparation.\nOverall, reviewers recommended both the course and Professor Stein, although many also said that Professor Stein\u2019s teaching style would be much better suited to an in-person and/or synchronous format. In particular, BIOL0800 was thought to be a good option for students on the pre-med track or anyone with an interest in human biology, but shoppers should be prepared for a difficult course requiring a high level of effort outside of class.\n\ninstructor: Instructors\nAndrea Smith\nandrea_jeanne_sobieraj@brown.edu\n\nschedule: Schedule and Location\nCourse offered online\n\naverage_hours: 6.01\n\nmax_hours: 10.74\n\ncourse_rating: 60%\n4.03\n\nprofessor_rating: 79%\n4.42\n\nprofessor_and_term: BIOL 0800 | Stein, John (S1) | Fall 2020\n\n", "code: BIOL 0940A\n\nterm: Fall 2024\n\ntitle: Viral Epidemics\n\ndescription: \u201cViral Epidemics\u201d (BIOL0940A) is a sophomore seminar that focuses on viruses-related diseases through a survey of epidemics of viral infections and the current literature.

This interactive course involves taking lots of field trips in the local Rhode Island area to enhance learning concepts such as plant morphology, taxonomy, and evolution. Other key skills include plant identification and understanding basic ecological processes. Students emphasized that no prior experience is necessary, though some noted that a basic background in biology or ecology could be helpful. A few noted that courses such as Diversity of Life (BIOL0210), Evolution of Plant Diversity (BIOL0430), or Invertebrate Zoology (BIOL0410) have similar-style content, but overall, the consensus was that prospective students only need to have a strong interest in plants to enjoy the course.\nRespondents emphasized Professor Rebecca Kartzinel\u2019s infectious enthusiasm for all things plants. Even after the field trips ended in the seventh week and the slideshow-based lectures became more complex and content-dense, most students felt that \"Becky,\" as they referred to the professor, presented lectures in an effective way that responded to class needs. One respondent noted that she always made sure everyone understood the content before moving on and that she was always happy to answer questions.\nThe course was structured around weekly readings, two field identification quizzes, a field notebook, a final plant collection, and a final exam. Students found the six field trips the most exciting and enriching component, though they noted that those with an interest in plants would also enjoy the later plant identification and lecture/lab. Additionally, they emphasized that while the four-hour period is a considerable time commitment, students aren\u2019t being lectured at the entire time\u2014 there were usually hands-on components, and the time went by quickly.

Beyond these listed courses, many students reported that a strong background in general biology and chemistry, courses such as \u201cBiomaterials'' (ENGN1490), and some experience working in a research lab, especially with cell cultures, were all particularly useful for success in this course.\nProfessor Diane Hoffman-Kim was applauded by her students for her effective and unique style of teaching. She splits class time between discussion of the assigned readings and a more traditional lecture-style presentation of the material. Highly praised for encouraging discourse and questions, many also appreciated how they felt that Professor Hoffman-Kim prioritized individual creativity and worked to ensure each individual understood the material. Respondents also praised Professor Hoffman-Kim for allowing each student to choose many topics for their assignments, letting them explore their interests.\nThe assignments for this class consisted of weekly readings, two papers, one take-home exam, and an individual project that culminated in a 15-minute presentation. The weekly readings were primary scientific articles that students felt were absolutely necessary to succeed in the course. One of the papers was a short article review paper and the other was a technical 10-page single-spaced scientific paper on one of the course\u2019s topics. The individual project at the end of the semester was a 15-minute presentation on a course topic to a general audience. Students mentioned this as one of their favorite aspects of the course as it stresses the importance of learning how to engage in non-technical communication and presentation of complicated scientific topics.\nAs a whole, reviewers truly enjoyed this class and Professor Hoffman-Kim's teachings. It was reported that even without a strong background in biology or upper-level science classes, success is still possible based on how much work is put in. Students who wish to take this class should note that there are not very many assignments, but they can be time-consuming. Reviewers highly recommended for students who wish to experience more lab- and research-like settings where there is not one true answer to a problem rather than a traditional science classroom environment.\n\ninstructor: Instructors\nDiane Hoffman-Kim\ndiane_hoffman-kim@brown.edu\n\nschedule: Schedule and Location\nW 3pm-5:30pm in Bio Med Center 305\n\naverage_hours: 2.40\n\nmax_hours: 9.20\n\ncourse_rating: 79%\n4.28\n\nprofessor_rating: 95%\n4.90\n\nprofessor_and_term: BIOL 1140 | Hoffman-Kim, Diane (S1) | Fall 2022\n\n", "code: BIOL 1150\n\nterm: Spring 2025\n\ntitle: Stem Cell Engineering\n\ndescription: \u201cStem Cell Engineering\u201d (BIOL1150) is a course that explores stem cell biology and stem cells\u2019 uses in regenerative therapies.

His class was noted to be very discussion-driven. Students saw him as fair and noted that he provided detailed feedback, especially in the laboratory, where he focused on the individual. This course has an inverted classroom format; students watch a video lecture every week ahead of class. Most students appreciated this because they thought the video lectures provided most of the dense information, leaving more time in class for discussions. Class discussions were praised for being engaging and for fostering a more collaborative classroom environment.\nThe assignments for this course included at-home lectures and readings, weekly comprehension quizzes, weekly labs, weekly online discussions, a midterm, and a full project including a proposal, presentation, and a paper. Most students agreed that the assignments were relevant and important. In addition, the combination of all of the different components (assignments, labs, projects, etc.) made the course extremely time-consuming, requiring students to be highly organized. A few respondents encouraged prospective students to S/NC this class, noting, however, that it still requires the same amount of work to pass, though it does relieve the pressure of a grade.\nDespite the demanding workload, students thoroughly enjoyed this class and thought they learned a lot from Professor Darling. This course is one-of-a-kind, and students felt strongly about its value and its focus on individual student improvement, specifically in the laboratory.

Students will be asked to engage in discussions regarding the contemporary problems of conservation biology. The most recommended prerequisite was the officially listed \u201cPrinciples of Ecology\u201d (BIOL0420) as it helped provide context coming into the class. Respondents also recommended \u201cEvolutionary Biology\u201d (BIOL0480) as it was helpful in approaching the material, but most reviewers felt that neither of these was necessary for success in the course.\nThere was unanimous praise for Professor Dov Sax as an engaging and passionate lecturer. His presentation of the material was found to be straightforward and robust. His receptiveness for questions, humor, and nuance during class were all acknowledged for making class interesting. The most noted factor to student enjoyment of the course was the time during lecture that professor Sax encouraged the discussion and debate of material with classmates. These discussions were considered one of the highlights of the class.\nCourse work consisted of required readings for both lecture and weekly discussion sessions, short quizzes during the discussion sessions, one midterm, and one final exam. The textbook readings were often covered in more detail during class, but could be helpful as a first pass at the diagrams. The readings for each discussion section were scientific papers, which many felt could be challenging if you didn\u2019t have some experience reading primary literature. The quizzes were found to be easy if you understood the readings. The exams were the most criticized portion of the class. The midterm was done during class and the final was take-home. Reviewers felt that they did a poor job of assessing the material. Noted for being lengthy and requiring very close reading of the questions, they often tested the memorization of random details rather than the application of knowledge stressed in other components of the class.\nOverall students seemed to enjoy the course, and while many found it to be an engaging and balanced introduction to the field of conservation biology, some expressed that the material could often feel repetitive if they had taken other ecology or environmental science classes.

The course, taught by Professor Bruce Becker and Professor Naz Karim, explores ideas related to critical care such as trauma, medical malpractice, refugee and disaster medicine, and more. While some reviewers said that introductory public health courses such as PHP0310 and PHP0320 helped prepare them for this course, others found that no background knowledge was necessary.\nReviewers described Professors Becker and Karim as very knowledgeable about the subject matter. They both shared personal insights from their experiences in the emergency medical field. There were few slides or similar materials during the lectures, so the course relied primarily on the professors\u2019 stories and in-class discussions. Most students considered these aspects of the course engaging, but a few mentioned that they made the class feel slightly unstructured. In this vein, students also mentioned that the course was participation-heavy, and some reviewers were intimidated that Professor Becker sometimes \u201ccold-called students.\u201d Nevertheless, most reviewers agreed that they learned effectively through in-class discussions.\nThe coursework for BIOL1530 included weekly two-page reflections on reading assignments, a midterm paper, a final group project and paper, and weekly films. The final group project included a product pitch to address an issue within the emergency department. Students also shadowed the emergency department at Rhode Island Hospital, which was essential to completing the midterm paper. Students noted that the grading was fair, but some would have appreciated more clarification on the grading process.\nOverall, students enjoyed the course \u201cEmergency Medical Systems\u201d and recommended BIOL1530 to students interested in the medical field or who are passionate about emergency medicine.

Several respondents also mentioned that NEUR1670 helped prepare them for this course.\nStudents appreciated the small class size, which facilitated productive class discussions. The class's primary instructor, Professor Anita Zimmerman, received unanimous praise for being an engaging and clear lecturer; according to reviewers, she was very adept at making even the most difficult concepts seem simple. In the words of one respondent, \"Professor Zimmerman is exactly the kind of professor who makes Brown great!\" The class also included many guest lectures, which students found highly variable in their effectiveness. Because of this, several respondents wished that Professor Zimmerman could give more lectures.\nRequired coursework included three non-cumulative exams, regular readings drawn from primary literature, and eight to ten problem sets. Occasionally, students found the primary literature rather dense. Nevertheless, most assignments were deemed appropriate in difficultly and highly useful in studying for the exams.\nMost survey respondents spent around three to four hours per week preparing for class; however, this figure rose to nearly ten hours per week during exam weeks. Overall, all respondents very enthusiastically recommended this course. Although there was a fair amount of work involved, it was also extremely rewarding. One student cautioned that although the class is called \"Molecular Pharmacology and Physiology,\" a fair amount constituted physiology review rather than pharmacology concepts, and suggested that students interested in pharmacology also shop classes such as NEUR1670 and BIOL1260 before making a final decision to enroll.

It is the major risk factor for age-related diseases such as cancer, cardiovascular disease, stroke, osteoporosis, arthritis and Alzheimer's, just to name a few. As life expectancy has increased in the 20th century, these diseases have become the leading causes of death. Recent research has identified universal mechanisms that regulate organismal aging and impact all organ systems. Several gene networks that can regulate the rate of aging and multiple age-related diseases have already been discovered. These mechanisms are conserved throughout evolution and many key insights have been garnered from simple model organisms. Manipulation of these networks has been achieved by diet, genetic engineering, and most recently, with drugs. The goal of modern medicine is to increase healthy survival, as opposed to simply longevity. It is now generally acknowledged that increasing health span \u2013 the fraction of our life spans free of frailty and debilitating chronic disease \u2013 has become a realistic goal. This course will examine the new concept of \"geroscience\" \u2013 the molecular, cellular, and genetic foundations of the biology of aging, and how this knowledge can be applied to therapies for age-associated diseases.

Several students noted that high-school chemistry and math were helpful, but no specific knowledge was required. In this course, Professor Willard presented a history of molecular structure, including the present-day technique of X-ray diffraction. Students unanimously felt that the class taught them useful concepts and gave them a stronger understanding of chemical research.\nClass members praised Professor Willard for taking time to assess their level of understanding and for constantly encouraging participation. Above all, they commented on his effective use of analogies in the presentation of the material, which was often difficult. A few students also noted that the professor could have been more organized and that a syllabus would have been helpful. However, this was only a minor issue, and, overall, respondents felt that Professor Willard's explanations made the course worthwhile. The professor, in turn, wrote that he was very pleased with the students' progress based on their questions.\nCoursework included two papers, a lab report, outside readings from articles, and four books. Although the survey respondents disagreed on which readings were most useful for the course, several cited the short novel, \"Flatland\" as the most interesting.\nMost students spent between two and five hours per week preparing for this course.

Although many students noted that high school chemistry (not AP/IB) was very helpful in understanding the material, there are no official prerequisites. Many reviewers even noted that having taken chemistry in high school certainly was not necessary for success in the course, as most of it was review for those who did take it in high school.\nMany students agreed that Professor Dani Blum\u2019s lecture slides were clear and comprehensive, and many considered them to be very helpful for students when they had to complete assignments or when it came time to study for exams. Also, many students appreciated Dr. Blum\u2019s willingness to answer questions in and outside of lectures. Furthermore, many students noted that the TopHat questions were useful, but occasionally the questions could be very repetitive and took too much time out of the lecture. Some students noted that Dr. Blum would make occasionally errors in her lectures that made concepts a little difficult to understand, but overall, reviewers generally thought Dr. Blum presented the material clearly and effectively, especially when seeking individual help.\nAssignments for the course consisted of TopHat questions during lectures, weekly problem sets, weekly conference quizzes, three in-class midterm exams, and one final exam.

On average, respondents dedicated spent about six hours working outside of class a week.\nAs a whole, respondents recommend this course to students with no chemistry background who are interested in a basic overview of the discipline, especially since it is mandatory S/NC, which reduces stress. It was recommended by some reviewers that those with a stronger chemistry background (having taken AP/IB, or even honors chemistry in high school) will want to shop \"Equilibrium, Rate, and Structure\" (CHEM0330).\n\ninstructor: Instructors\nMatthew Lueckheide\nmatthew_lueckheide@brown.edu\n\nschedule: Schedule and Location\nMWF 11am-11:50am in MacMillan Hall 117\n\naverage_hours: 6.46\n\nmax_hours: 9.79\n\ncourse_rating: 54%\n3.35\n\nprofessor_rating: 64%\n3.47\n\nprofessor_and_term: CHEM 0100 | Blum, Dani (S1) | Fall 2022\n\n", "code: CHEM 0330\n\nterm: Fall 2024\n\ntitle: Equilibrium, Rate, and Structure\n\ndescription: \u201cEquilibrium, Rate, and Structure\u201d (CHEM0330) is an introductory chemistry course that covers the electronic structure of atoms and molecules, thermodynamics, solution equilibrium, electrochemistry, chemical kinetics, and reaction mechanisms. Students who wish to enroll in CHEM0330 must have completed CHEM0100, have received a minimum score of 4 in AP Chemistry or a score of 5 in IB HL Chemistry, or scored a minimum of 08 on the CHEM Placement Test. Respondents generally agreed that a strong background in chemistry was a must to be successful in this course.\nThis course was team-taught, with Professor Christoph Rose-Petruck as the primary instructor, Professor Dani Blum running the conference section, and Professor Matthew Lueckheide as the lab professor. A large portion of the lectures focused on derivations of relevant equations, which most respondents felt went over their heads and made it challenging to apply concepts from lectures. However, students did appreciate how responsive Professor Rose-Petruck was to students' questions as well as his friendly and welcoming nature.\nCoursework for CHEM0330 included online homework assignments every other week, seven labs (including a pre-lab and lab report for each), and three exams. Students found the online homework assignments especially useful for practicing applying course concepts. Reviewers reported spending the most time on weekly labs and lab assignments and noted that the concepts presented in lab felt largely separate from topics covered in lecture.\nOverall, students found CHEM0330 to be a challenging introductory chemistry course. Class members recommended the course for those looking to fill a major requirement or anyone looking to take higher level chemistry courses. Reviewers advised prospective students to make sure they have a solid understanding of topics from CHEM0100 or high school chemistry and to be prepared to spend a significant amount of time outside of class in order to succeed.\n\ninstructor: Instructors\nRichard Stratt\nrichard_stratt@brown.edu\n\nschedule: Schedule and Location\nMWF 10am-10:50am in MacMillan Hall 117\n\naverage_hours: 4.77\n\nmax_hours: 10.79\n\ncourse_rating: 45%\n3.06\n\nprofessor_rating: 57%\n3.08\n\nprofessor_and_term: CHEM 0330 | Rose-Petruck, Christoph (S2) | Fall 2022\n\n", "code: CHEM 0330L\n\nterm: Fall 2024\n\ntitle: Equilibrium, Rate, and Structure Lab\n\ndescription: Please see course description for CHEM 0330.\n\ninstructor: Instructors\nLi-Qiong Wang\nli_qiong_wang@brown.edu\n\nschedule: Schedule and Location\nM 1pm-4:50pm in MacMillan Hall 205\n\ncritical_review_url: http://www.thecriticalreview.org/CHEM/0330L\n\n", "code: CHEM 0350\n\nterm: Summer 2024\n\ntitle: Organic Chemistry I\n\ndescription: *Please note that this course was taught online - this review may not be reflective of future semesters*\n\u201cOrganic Chemistry\u201d (CHEM0350) is an introduction to the constitution and properties of the different classes of organic compounds, with considerable emphasis on reaction mechanisms.

The prerequisite for the course is \"Equilibrium, Rate, and Structure\" (CHEM0330), and students stressed the importance of a solid foundation in chemistry, particularly the quantum unit from CHEM0330.\nThe instructor, Professor Charles Morton, received mixed reviews. Many respondents appreciated his enthusiasm as well as receptiveness to students' needs. However, reviewers believed that the course could have been better with more organized planning and more effective communication from the professor. Some felt that Professor Morton\u2019s lectures sometimes went off on tangents or became confusing which made learning complicated concepts more difficult.\nCoursework consisted of readings and quizzes for each lecture, Canvas posts in preparation for lab, five problem sets, five lab reports, two midterms, and one final exam.

CHEM0360 focuses on the constitution and properties of organic compounds. The official prerequisite is CHEM0350, which students mentioned as extremely important. Students also cited CHEM0330 as an important course to understand concepts for CHEM0360.\nProfessor Paul Williard received mostly mixed reviews from students. While many praised his extensive knowledge of the subject, others noted that he often went on tangents that were not always relevant to the course. Students were expected to be familiar with the textbook material that lectures discussed, following a question-answer format. Several noted that supplementing Professor Williard\u2019s lectures with watching recordings of Professor Charles Morton\u2019s lectures was the best way to learn course content. Students recommend solving TA packets and attending problem-solving sessions, as they were an extremely helpful way to practice concepts learned in class.\nCourse requirements include textbook readings before every class, five to seven homework assignments throughout the semester, three midterms, and one in-person final with an optional take-home component. Other assignments included pre-lab quizzes for weekly required labs. Homework assignments were found useful but posted late and infrequently. Exams were notably difficult, with students reporting that there was not always clear communication about content they were expected to be familiar with for the assessments.\nOverall, CHEM0360 is an extremely challenging course that requires a large time commitment and extensive, regular practice.

One respondent stated, unlike other biology courses, \"the course is not a memorization-focused course broadly covering the field, but rather focused on enzymes and their catalysis via frequent interaction with the primary literature.\u201d Respondents recommended this course for all students who want to take a deep dive into primary literature and who are interested in exploring biochemistry further.\n\ninstructor: Instructors\nJesse Morin\njesse_morin@brown.edu\n\nschedule: Schedule and Location\nTTh 9am-10:20am in CIT Center (Thomas Watson CIT) 219\n\naverage_hours: 4.00\n\nmax_hours: 7.00\n\ncourse_rating: 40%\n4.25\n\nprofessor_rating: 65%\n4.86\n\nprofessor_and_term: CHEM 1240 | Morin, Jesse (S1) | Fall 2023\n\n", "code: CHEM 1450\n\nterm: Spring 2025\n\ntitle: Advanced Organic Chemistry\n\ndescription: \u201cAdvanced Organic Chemistry\u201d (CHEM1450) is a higher level continuation of the CHEM0350 and CHEM0360 sequence. The course covers topics in organic reaction mechanisms, synthesis, and structure determination, building upon the foundations developed in the previous two organic chemistry courses. The formal prerequisite is CHEM0360, but some students mentioned that BIOL0280 could be helpful.\nRespondents agreed that Professor Christopher Seto\u2019s teaching style was highly effective. Students especially thought that Professor Seto\u2019s method of alternating between lectures and student participation in problem-solving on the board was engaging and aided them in understanding the material. Respondents appreciated Professor Seto\u2019s enthusiasm for the course material. However, reviewers expressed frustration with the timing of the class (8:30 in the morning on MWF) and the classroom assignment, a lab where food and drinks (especially coffee) were prohibited.\nThe workload for the course consisted of optional textbook readings, eight problem sets, seven quizzes, eight five-hour-long lab sessions, and a final lab paper. Though students reported that the problem sets were time-consuming and difficult, they nonetheless believed the problem sets were essential in achieving a firm grasp of the material. Assessments were open-book but still difficult. Students thought that the final lab, making ice cream with liquid nitrogen, was a great way to end the course.\nOverall, students reported that they learned a ton from the course and highly recommended it to those who have an interest in higher level chemistry. However, shoppers should be prepared to spend a large amount of time on this class. Some students suggested shopping it and judging whether to take it based on the first problem set.

The official prerequisites for this course are CHEM0350 and one of PHYS0030 or PHYS0050, with BIOL0280 also recommended on the syllabus. Many respondents also noted that experience in upper-level Engineering courses was helpful, particularly \"Materials Science\" (ENGN0410).\nProfessor Shouheng Sun taught the course entirely from lecture PowerPoint slides, which most reviewers found an effective medium. Professor Sun was commended for his thoroughness and passion in presentation as well as his receptiveness to students' needs and questions during lecture. A couple of students indicated that they would have preferred a greater ability to contribute to lectures, as the repetitiveness and lack of supplementary content and assignments (e.g. lecture-based homework, quizzes, or exams) made it difficult at times to stay focused and engaged. Additionally, respondents wished that Professor Sun would have provided more relevant practice materials for the exams, as the exam content sometimes seemed unfamiliar and unpredictable in scope.\nAssignments for this course were minimal; students' entire grade was based on three midterm exams and one final term paper and presentation. Respondents found expectations for these assignments subjective and vague and would have preferred additional feedback from Professor Sun. Members of the class appreciated the flexibility that Professor Sun offered students in exploring their own interests with regard to the final paper and presentation.\nOverall, students found the course reasonably challenging and spoke highly of Professor Sun's knowledge and passion for the material. Respondents noted that the variety of material covered could prove challenging and that the hands-off nature of the class better suited highly motivated students. As such, reviewers recommended this course largely to concentrators with an interest in nanoparticle synthesis, while non-concentrators may be better served by other courses in the Chemistry Department.\n\ninstructor: Instructors\nShouheng Sun\nshouheng_sun@brown.edu\n\nschedule: Schedule and Location\nMWF 11am-11:50am in Geo-Chemistry Building 351\n\naverage_hours: 7.33\n\nmax_hours: 13.33\n\ncourse_rating: 55%\n4.17\n\nprofessor_rating: 78%\n4.33\n\nprofessor_and_term: CHEM 1700 | Sun, Shouheng (S1) | Fall 2021\n\n", "code: CHEM 2010\n\nterm: Fall 2024\n\ntitle: Advanced Thermodynamics\n\ndescription: \u201cAdvanced Thermodynamics\u201d (CHEM2010) is a graduate-level course that explores the fundamental principles of material science thermodynamics and their applications. There are no prerequisites for this course, though some students found physical chemistry and undergraduate-level thermodynamics courses to be helpful.\nStudents emphasized their appreciation for Professor Christoph Rose-Petruck\u2019s lecture style, passion for course material, clear feedback on assignments, and understanding of student needs. Respondents found the professor's lectures to be precise and clear, noting that his teaching style remained effective despite online learning. Students appreciated Professor Rose-Petruck\u2019s efforts at engaging students, particularly with more mundane concepts such as proofs. One reviewer found his detailed derivations of equations and relations to be very effective. Professor Rose-Petruck made effective use of class time and encouraged student discussion as well. Although he posted his lecture slides for later reference, students would have liked to see more explanatory written material, especially to ground what are largely theoretical concepts.\nThe workload for CHEM2010 entailed applications of theory learned during lecture and included readings with responses, biweekly homework assignments (which the syllabus claims are not graded), a midterm exam, and a final exam. Respondents mostly found the readings worthwhile. Fewer homework assignments, though they were deemed useful, meant there were not many example problems to work with when preparing for exams. Nevertheless, students found the assignments to be fairly and timely graded, recognizing that the questions involved applications of theory rather than rote memorization of material. One student did note the difficulty of certain exam questions that required putting theory into action. Reviewers also said that the beginning of the course was relatively easier than the later parts.\nStudents enjoyed CHEM2010 as a foundational course for concentrators and non-concentrators alike.

There are no official prerequisites for this course, though many students had prior exposure to Chinese through classes in high school.\nThere were four professors who taught the class in a seminar style, all of whom asked many questions in class and called on students to respond. This format allowed instructors to give immediate and constructive feedback about the students' Chinese pronunciations, which many respondents appreciated. The instructors were described as patient and encouraging, as well as readily available to meet with students outside of class.\nAssignments for CHIN0100 consisted of daily listening and reading homework, two quizzes per week, oral skits, occasional speech recordings, four exams, and a final that had both written and oral components. Students commented on the time commitment required for such a constant flow of assignments, but generally felt that all the work was necessary for learning the language, despite the difficulty at times.\nOverall, students highly recommended this class for shoppers interested in learning Chinese. Highlights of the class included the oral skits and the two-on-one sessions, which were weekly fifteen minute sessions with an instructor to practice pronunciation, vocabulary, and sentence structure. In general, students suggested that the course could be improved by slowing down the pace and including more opportunities to practice with less structured conversation. Students recommended other classes in Chinese history to interested students.

If you answered yes, you should take \"Basic Chinese\" (CHIN0200), the second semester of the year-long introduction to Chinese language. This course meets five days a week to maximize language practice in reading, writing, grammar, and speaking skills. Students must complete CHIN0100 before taking the course, but some students reported having previous experience with Chinese in high school or had no prior experience at all.\nThe course description lists one instructor, Professor Yang Wang, but respondents noted that there were actually four rotating professors. This was helpful for experiencing a variety of teaching methods to find a style that students learned best from. Overall, the instructors were \"always willing to push you\" in an effective way and one respondent remarked that all of the professors \"had so much patience.\" Powerpoints were used but students reported that they were very effective because of the instructors' enthusiasm and engaging teaching methods. If help was needed outside of class, it was always available and email responses were fairly quick. A unique aspect of this course is the two-on-one mandatory weekly meetings with a professor to practice conversational Chinese in a more individual-focused environment. Students felt that these meetings were very helpful for improving their speaking skills.\nThe assignments for CHIN0200 included nightly homework of dialogue memorization, workbook assignments, and character practice. There were vocabulary quizzes every week, online quizzes, readings, oral presentations, five unit exams and a written and oral final. Students agreed that all of the assignments were relevant and manageable --often reinforcing what was learned in class.\nOverall, students were surprised with how much Chinese they learned and attributed this to the professors' patience and encouragement throughout the difficult, but manageable course. They found the course to be a big time commitment but that it was very rewarding. One respondent concluded that CHIN0200 \"demands passion and willingness to fail to become great.\"\n\ninstructor: Instructors\nLiwei Jiao\nliwei_jiao@brown.edu\nYang Wang\nyang_wang@brown.edu\nJia-Lin Huang Hsieh\njia-lin_huang@brown.edu\nPin-Chi Chen\npin-chi_chen@brown.edu\n\nschedule: Schedule and Location\nMWF 9am-9:50am Location TBD\nTTh 9:30am-10:20am Location TBD\n\nprograms: Curricular Programs\nSecond Half of Year Course (YC02)\n\naverage_hours: 7.80\n\nmax_hours: 10.60\n\ncourse_rating: 58%\n4.98\n\nprofessor_rating: 74%\n5.00\n\nprofessor_and_term: CHIN 0200 | Wang, Yang (S1) | Spring 2017\n\n", "code: CHIN 0300\n\nterm: Fall 2024\n\ntitle: Intermediate Chinese\n\ndescription: \"Intermediate Chinese\" (CHIN0300) is an intermediate language course that focuses on improving students\u2019 abilities to read, write, and communicate in Mandarin Chinese. The class meets five days a week and class sizes are small to increase student-teacher interaction. Though it is not required, many students will continue on to CHIN0400, a spring semester course that acts as a continuation of the material seen in CHIN0300. The official prerequisites for Intermediate Chinese are CHIN0100 and CHIN0200, and students felt that these aforementioned classes were immensely helpful in preparing them for CHIN0300.\nCHIN0300, much like other introductory Chinese courses at Brown, was taught by a rotation of multiple professors, so that students could gain several different perspectives on Chinese language and culture. Jiao Laoshi, Wang Laoshi, and Hsieh Laoshi were praised across the board and described as dedicated, passionate, and engaging. Professors utilized PowerPoint presentations and example-based lectures to teach, which reviewers found effective. The professors were also readily available, both after class and also during their office hours, which respondents found helpful.\nCoursework for CHIN0300 included four noncumulative exams, three oral presentations, weekly quizzes, and an abundance of homework assignments that involved translation, listening, and character memorization. Though students opinions\u2019 varied on the difficulty of the homework assignments, the work was seen as worthwhile and relevant to the curriculum. A few students commented on the amount of work assigned, stating that it was \u201ctoo many assignments to stay on top of.\u201d\nGenerally speaking, reviewers enjoyed this course. Several class members strongly urged prospective students to shop and/or take the class, but to be aware that the course is rather time-consuming.

A lot of students had a background in speaking Chinese at home or going to a Chinese school, which they claim has helped prepare them for this course.\nInstructor Lung-Hua Hu\u2019s teaching style consisted of daily handouts with explanations of vocabulary, translation exercises, and discussion questions. Reviewers claimed the teaching style was effective and enjoyable, as it helped them see how vocabulary is used besides the examples demonstrated in the textbook. Students received daily reports and feedback for assignments, but never for essays, or oral reports, which some found frustrating. The instructor was also very much available outside the classroom to help or provide feedback.\nThe course assignments consisted of daily quizzes, three midterm exams, four oral presentations, and three essays. Students found the assignments time-consuming as they found it very hard to keep up with the daily quizzes, but in the long run students found them helpful for learning new vocabulary. Other than the daily quizzes, students thought the rest of the assignments were easy and provided good opportunities to practice new vocabulary.\nOverall, students found the instructor to be passionate and driven. Students very much seemed to enjoy discussions, where the instructor would raise philosophical and ethical questions. Many students seemed to have wanted more in-class time to go over vocabulary. Otherwise, they saw no need for an improvement and enjoyed the way it was run.

The class focuses on honing students\u2019 listening, speaking, reading, and writing skills. In addition, students learn how to express abstract ideas and improve their detailing abilities. Prerequisites of this course include CHIN0250 and CHIN0400. Most students had previous intensive experience with Chinese prior to studying it in college.\nStudents appreciated that Professor Yang Wang encouraged all of them to participate in discussions and class activities. The professor made corrections to students\u2019 pronunciation and grammar, which made \u201call students comfortable with speaking up and contributing to the class.\u201d In addition, reviewers appreciated that the professor clearly explained what each week\u2019s readings were and what class time would be spent on. Respondents liked how Professor Wang would use the assigned readings to broaden and strengthen their knowledge in class.\nStudents indicated that the course moved at a fast pace and that they had to commit to studying the material daily to keep up. Assignments included daily homework, two weekly quizzes, two papers during the semester, and three in-class exams. Time commitment varied from as little as two hours to eight hours a week, overall suggesting that the workload is manageable.\nOverall, students felt that they learned a lot from the course and thoroughly enjoyed it.

Taught by three professors, Yang Wang, Jia-Lin H. Hsieh, and Hsin-I Tseng, the course focused on improving overall proficiency in the Chinese language. Reviewers noted that previous Chinese courses in the sequence, namely CHIN0300, CHIN0400, and CHIN0500, were sufficient and definitely helpful in preparing for the course.\nProfessors Wang, Xie, and Zeng were all lauded by reviewers for their approachability, friendliness, and passion to help their students learn. The instructors held numerous office hours, which not only enabled students to get the help they needed but allowed for opportunities to practice the language, the true objective of the class.\nAssignments included three exams, two oral presentations, daily mini-quizzes, weekly homework assignments, and three essays. Although reviewers noted that the assignments were often time-consuming, they found them to further their understanding of the Chinese language drastically. The smaller assignments, especially the vocab quizzes, also helped limit studying in the long run; one reviewer even noted that \"if you stayed caught up with the class, you almost didn't have to study.\" Furthermore, many reviewers praised the complexity and real-life relevance of the texts discussed in class, in addition to the original Chinese texts studied, noting that it enabled learning that stretched \"beyond the language,\" as one review put it. Reviewers also praised the use of visuals (e.g. PowerPoint slides, movies) to enhance the learning of the language.\nOverall, the students found the course to be relevant and commended the professors' passion.

She was praised for her positivity and flexibility, which allowed the course to be accessible to many students. Additionally, she was complimented for her efforts in engaging all the students in class and using relevant materials to teach Chinese. Wang Laoshi was described as passionate and one student said that there is nothing they would change about her.\nAssignments for the course included two essays, daily homework assignments, and oral presentations. There were also multiple quizzes throughout the semester and three tests. Prospective students are advised to review lessons after class and to use audio files in conjunction with the textbook to ensure that they have the highest level of understanding.\nOverall, students highly recommended others to take this course, even if they are not prospective concentrators. However, one student did mention that, since this is a higher level Chinese course, there are higher expectations, making this course a little more difficult than CHIN0500 and CHIN0600.

However, respondents hoped that Professor Bodel could leave more time for students to ask questions during lecture time, especially in virtual learning. The TAs were praised for effectively leading discussions in sections and answering any questions students had.\nAssignments for the course consisted of two readings per week, synchronous discussions in sections, and four quizzes. Students also had the choice of doing either five shorter reflections and one long paper, or two reflections and two papers. Respondents generally agreed that assignments were both helpful and relevant to the course material. However, they sometimes found that the quizzes did not always perfectly reflect the material covered in class.\nOverall, class members recommended CLAS1320 for anyone who is interested in ancient history, Latin, or the classics. One respondent remarked that while the course is a fair amount of work, anyone who is interested in the material will certainly find it rewarding. Prospective students are also advised to shop \"Roman History I: The Rise and Fall of an Imperial Republic\" (CLAS1310) and \"Formation of the Classical Heritage: Greeks, Romans, Jews, Christians, and Muslims\" (HIST1202).\n\ninstructor: Instructors\nJohn Bodel\njohn_bodel@brown.edu\n\nschedule: Schedule and Location\nMWF 12pm-12:50pm in Friedman Hall 201\n\nprograms: Curricular Programs\nWriting - Designated Courses (WRIT)\n\naverage_hours: 5.73\n\nmax_hours: 9.82\n\ncourse_rating: 59%\n3.99\n\nprofessor_rating: 78%\n4.62\n\nprofessor_and_term: CLAS 1320 | Bodel, John (S1) | Fall 2020\n\n", "code: CLAS 2011\n\nterm: Fall 2024\n\ntitle: Critical Approaches to Classical Texts: Theory and Methods\n\ndescription: These seminars will examine categories fundamental to the study of ancient literature and historiography, highlighting the relevance of ancient philosophy, rhetoric and poetics to modern critical/theoretical approaches.

CLPS0010 serves as an introduction to a wide variety of fields, including psychology, cognitive science, cognitive neuroscience, behavioral neuroscience, computational modeling, and linguistics. This course has no official prerequisites and students mentioned that no background experience was needed to be prepared. Some students did note, however, that there was some overlap between CLPS0010 and high school psychology classes, as well as other courses in the CLPS department.\nThis course was taught by Professor Elena Festa, whom students lauded for her passion and enthusiasm. Reviewers mentioned that Professor Festa was welcoming and friendly, and encouraged them to engage with the material. Some respondents wished that there was more structure in Professor Festa\u2019s PowerPoint presentations and less emphasis on examples, as it made it harder to discern important concepts for assessments.\nCoursework included four writing assignments, online quizzes and activities, and online writing labs. Section attendance and participation were important to the final grade, and there were four in-class quizzes and a final exam. There was also extra credit granted for research participation. Reviewers described the assignments as being manageable overall but advised prospective students to keep up with them so their work does not pile up.\nOverall, respondents recommended this course to those who are interested in the CLPS department, but do not know exactly which fields to dive into. CLPS0010 is a broad introduction to multiple different fields of study and students are advised to take higher-level courses in the fields that interest them.

Many reviewers had taken other classes in the CLPS department before but noted that their previous knowledge was not necessary.\nStudents described Professor Joo-Hyun Song as passionate, energetic, and encouraging. One particularly enthused reviewer wrote that Professor Song is an \u201camazing human being who makes the class worth it.\u201d Her instruction style is predominantly lecture-based with accompanying PowerPoint slides, which most students found effective. However, several students wished that lectures had moved at a slower pace and that they were posted on Lecture Capture, which would have enabled students to catch up outside of class. Reviewers also noted Professor Song was very willing to meet with students outside of class and was responsive to emails.\nAssignments for this course included readings, two in-class exams, and a research project which included a proposal, a presentation, and a final paper. Reviewers found that the exams were fair and very reflective of lecture slides. They also found the research project, which challenged them to create their own illusion, fun and interesting.\nOverall, students enjoyed and recommended this course. They particularly enjoyed the illusions that Professor Song started each class with as well as the process of creating their own. With regard to improving the course in the future, many students suggested that the course be offered later in the day, finding the 8:30 AM start time too early.

Students emphasized that she was an excellent speaker and a knowledgeable researcher, and that the lectures were very engaging learning experiences. However, some felt that she could be not as understanding of individual circumstances at times. The majority of reviewers also reported that grading policies could be confusing, making the class \u201cmuch more difficult than expected.\u201d\nCoursework consisted of readings for every lecture with five reading quizzes, one midterm, one final, and a research project.

There are no official prerequisites for CLPS0900, but students found a general background in statistics, particularly high school AP Statistics, and familiarity with the programming language R to be helpful.\nProfessor Costa was described as an organized and effective lecturer who made good use of module notes on Canvas. Students generally agreed that the instructor was skilled at explaining individual concepts, but some found it difficult to see how certain concepts related to one another, especially given the volume of content covered in the course.

The class seeks to view the impacts of sleep from a behavioral health standpoint with a strong emphasis on its impact on the brain. Many respondents found NEUR0010, one of the class\u2019s recommended prerequisites, very helpful in making connections with concepts in the course. One student cited that the professor would often leave basic concepts unexplained with the justification, \u201c[you] learned this in NEUR0010\u201d. Other respondents have also found CLPS0010 helpful but not to the same extent as NEUR0010.\nProfessor Mary Carskadon was well-liked by all respondents. In particular, students applauded both her expertise and passion for topics discussed in class, and appreciated her directness when teaching content. However, some reviewers found the discussions expected of an upper-level seminar overshadowed by more lecture-style classes, as Professor Carskadon covered extensive material. Overall, students noted that the lectures were content-rich, and applauded her direct and funny demeanor.\nThe course was structured with 11 weekly readings along with 11 corresponding responses and analyses. Along with that, there were four quizzes and a paper and presentation that students work on throughout the semester on a relevant topic of their choice. The weekly reading analysis was structured to be about one double-spaced page in length, while the quizzes were take-home, with the one with the lowest grade being dropped. Reviewers often found the quizzes difficult, even with the take-home structure.\nStudents emphasized the importance of a fundamental base of knowledge, especially with NEUR0010 material. While the first half of the course starts with the students familiarizing themselves with the relevant vocabulary, neurological systems, and lab techniques, the second half is characterized by working on the final presentation and paper where students hone in on a topic of their choice.

Students then had to write a weekly one-page reflection on one of the three articles. In place of one of the reflections, students had to prepare a 15 to 30 minute presentation on one of the articles. The final paper for the course was a 10 to 15-page research proposal.\nOverall, respondents were happy with this course and the professor. One student noted that the scientific articles were difficult to read, but a lot of time would be spent discussing them. They suggested that what a student takes away from this course is entirely up to them and how much effort they put into it. Students recommended this class for non-concentrators as well as people with a background in cognitive neuroscience. One student recommended that others take any of Professor Song\u2019s courses.\n\ninstructor: Instructors\nJoo-Hyun Song\njoo-hyun_song@brown.edu\n\nschedule: Schedule and Location\nT 4pm-6:30pm Location TBD\n\naverage_hours: 2.80\n\nmax_hours: 6.40\n\ncourse_rating: 51%\n3.83\n\nprofessor_rating: 71%\n4.47\n\nprofessor_and_term: CLPS 1560 | Song, Joo-Hyun (S1) | Fall 2020\n\n", "code: CLPS 1565\n\nterm: Winter 2025\n\ntitle: The Sense of Smell: Perception, Cognition, Health & Technology\n\ndescription: In this course students will discover the fascinating and unique features of the human sense of smell with a special focus on how the sensory, perceptual, and psychological mechanisms of olfaction are involved in our emotions, thoughts, behavior, health, and the latest innovations and applications in technology.

Our everyday lives contain examples of strangers making sacrifices for the benefits of others. For instance, humans donate money, blood, or even a kidney to complete strangers in times of need. That being said, it is hard to ignore that many of the problems we face as a society, such as climate change, remain intractable in part because of individuals' lack of willingness to incur monetary costs to benefit others.

Respondents mentioned \"Personality Theory\" (CLPS0710), \"Mind, Brain and Behavior: An Interdisciplinary Approach\" (CLPS0010), \"The Brain: An Introduction to Neuroscience\" (NEUR0010), and AP Psychology in high school as providing helpful background knowledge, but they are by no means necessary to succeed in this class.\nClass members praised Professor Ellis for her in-depth, efficiently structured lectures that combine her personal experience in the field with academic knowledge of the subject to go beyond textbook material. Most felt that her lectures were fast-paced but clear and effective, although some suggested that she slow down denser lectures. Respondents also noted that Professor Ellis addressed hard topics with the utmost sensitivity and respect, was conscious of how people might be affected by the material, and was responsive to student needs and questions.\nAssignments for the course consisted of weekly readings, weekly short essay responses to readings (about two paragraphs), weekly take-home quizzes on Canvas, and four take-home, open-note exams. The lowest exam grade was dropped. Students generally found the assignments to be manageable and worthwhile but noted that they could be repetitive.\nOverall, respondents greatly enjoyed this course, and recommend it to anyone interested, regardless of background knowledge.

A general knowledge of the brain\u2019s anatomy as well as prior experience with other disciplines such as sociology, philosophy, or economics was also found to contribute to success. Students emphasized an ability to read and comprehend dense primary literature.\nTaught by Professor Oriel FeldmanHall, the course mostly consisted of guest speakers or student presentations. Professor FeldmanHall was praised for her ability to facilitate meaningful discussions while still managing to cover all of the material. Students also appreciated that she created a welcoming environment for asking questions. A point of criticism, however, was that most of the learning for the course was from the student presentations or guest speakers, and respondents would have liked to hear more from Professor FeldmanHall.\nDue to the seminar nature, the class was almost entirely based in discussions that relied heavily on the weekly reading assignments. As such, each of the readings had corresponding discussion posts on Canvas. Other work included creating and delivering a presentation, participating in an in-class debate, and writing a final paper. The final paper was based on the student research projects, and it was noted that beginning the project as early as possible was essential for success.\nThere were mixed opinions on this course among the reviewers, but the overall consensus seemed to be that you get out what you put into the class.

Graduate students have no prerequisites.\nReviewers found that the professor spent a small fraction of class time lecturing, and he \u201cencouraged discussion of papers and of current events related to prejudice and racism.\u201d The professor was enthusiastic and passionate about the material, and the students found themselves very engaged in class discussions. Students also noted that the professor was understanding, accommodating, and fun to discuss with.\nAssignments in this course included four research papers to read per week, one one-page paper per week in response to the readings, one midterm, one final exam, and a poster project. For spring 2020, these assignments remained the same except that students wrote a final reflection paper instead of the final exam and poster project. Reviewers found the readings necessary to complete in order to do well in the course and stated that the readings were \u201cquite interesting\u201d and not difficult to complete. One student noted that this course was \"heavily based on free and open discussion [and] not so much on assignments.\u201d Overall, the workload was described to be generally manageable. On average, students spent three to six hours per week outside of class for this course. Respondents had no feedback on how assignments, or other aspects of the course, could be improved.\nOverall, respondents found CLPS1770 to be engaging, interesting, and relevant to daily life.

Some students suggested that some experience in literary analysis would be helpful but certainly not necessary as the professor and TAs were able to help students with the skills needed for success.\nCOLT0510K is taught by Professor Elias Muhanna. Students were eager to express their appreciation for Professor Muhanna\u2019s deep understanding of the material and his ability to engage students in the classroom. His conversational lectures and modern popular culture references made it easy for students to learn in class. Though the course was taught as a lecture, Professor Muhanna was very open to hearing different perspectives. Some students expressed a desire for a more detailed guide on how to do a close reading for the final paper. Despite this, students agreed that Professor Muhanna was a very available and accommodating professor and was open to helping students.\nThis course consisted of weekly readings and three literary analysis papers. There were three sets of readings per week before every class, and each took about an hour to complete. Two of the papers were five-page essays and had different prompt options. The final paper was ten pages, and the students decided on their own prompts.\nOverall, students enjoyed taking \u201cThe 1001 Nights.\u201d Professor Muhanna was an engaging instructor and was eager to help students. Though some students who took the course were not completely satisfied with their TAs, the classes and the material made up for it. Some non-concentrators recommended taking the course S/NC but still greatly enjoyed the course.\n\ninstructor: Instructors\nElias Muhanna\nelias_muhanna@brown.edu\n\nschedule: Schedule and Location\nMWF 1pm-1:50pm Location TBD\n\nprograms: Curricular Programs\nWriting - Designated Courses (WRIT)\n\naverage_hours: 4.09\n\nmax_hours: 10.33\n\ncourse_rating: 47%\n4.03\n\nprofessor_rating: 69%\n4.67\n\nprofessor_and_term: COLT 0510K | Muhanna, Elias (S1) | Fall 2021\n\n", "code: COLT 0610L\n\nterm: Fall 2024\n\ntitle: Murder Ink: Narratives of Crime, Discovery, and Identity\n\ndescription: Examines the narrative of detection, beginning with the great dramatic whodunit (and mystery of identity) Oedipus Rex.

How did literature contribute to the formation of the Third-Worldist project, and how did the Third-Worldist project inform the writing of literature? We will approach these questions by examining the role of conferences, print periodicals, and supranational organizations like the Afro-Asian Writers Association in shaping new understandings of the politicized function of literature.

However, those under Iberian and British Rule\u2014in Peru, Mexico and New England\u2014found ways to resist and negotiate the terms of domination by adopting, and therefore adapting, European forms and norms. This class takes an interdisciplinary approach that combines historiography, literature, and art, to analyze the mechanisms of Indigenous resistance within the developing structures of colonialism: race, religion, geography, and gender.

This course centers around the construction and development of the concept of happiness through the early modern period. There are no prerequisites for this course, as it is a first-year seminar, though one student underscored a general interest in the course material as helpful.\nProfessor Ourida Mostefai was praised for her passion for the class and the readings. Students particularly appreciated her contextual commentary and background information on the texts. Reviewers felt that this understanding of why a text was written and how it was received led to enriching, productive conversations. One respondent highlighted how Professor Mostefai encouraged class members to consider their own interpretations of happiness through some of the course assignments. However, given that this course was discussion-based, some respondents felt that the course would have been enhanced by more time given to student-directed discussion.\nThe coursework consisted of readings, three online discussion posts each week, and three papers. The class also required an oral presentation on a topic of the student\u2019s choosing. Students noted that the readings varied extensively in terms of length, though they were consistently worthwhile and thought-provoking. One reviewer noted that Professor Mostefai would occasionally post excerpted versions of the readings in order to help students manage longer assignments.\nOverall, students recommend \"The Pursuit of Happiness.\" The intellectually stimulating and friendly environment created by Professor Mostefai was a key factor in their enjoyment and education in the course. As potential improvements to the course, students suggested more timely, transparent grading, and more student-run discussions. Still, for any students interested or curious about this concept and taking a first-year seminar, \"The Pursuit of Happiness\" seems like an excellent choice.\n\ninstructor: Instructors\nOurida Mostefai\nourida_mostefai@brown.edu\n\nschedule: Schedule and Location\nTTh 2:30pm-3:50pm in Prospect House 102\n\nprograms: Curricular Programs\nFirst Year Seminar (FYS)\nWriting - Designated Courses (WRIT)\n\naverage_hours: 3.33\n\nmax_hours: 6.83\n\ncourse_rating: 44%\n3.83\n\nprofessor_rating: 70%\n4.72\n\nprofessor_and_term: COLT 0810L | Mostefai, Ourida (S1) | Fall 2021\n\n", "code: COLT 0811Z\n\nterm: Fall 2024\n\ntitle: Islands in the Western Imaginary: Paradise, Periphery, Prison\n\ndescription: Paradise, periphery, or prison? The representation of the island has been described as imaginary and not actual, mythological and not geographical. Examines the fascination with islands in the western cultural imaginary. Selective readings from literature, film and historical texts focus on ways in which island spaces have been represented in diverse social, national, imperial contexts as well as the effect of such projections on the native islanders, their visitors and often subjugators.

Through a sampling of poetry, narrative, and film, we will explore the uneven terrain of the Anthropocene, in which the feedback loops of race, class, gender, and other forms of social difference, along with geography itself, continue to separate humans, even as evidence mounts for the inseparability of humans from the rest of the planet, including its nonhuman inhabitants.

Taking as our point of departure the relation of literature and \"light-writing,\" we will address selected issues in the historical and conceptual interaction among word, image, and critical thought. Our wager: texts and photographic images share a common relationship to time, desire, death, mourning, and politics.

This course is for advanced undergraduates, but there are no official prerequisites. Useful background suggested by students consisted mainly of Literature courses, both in the COLT department and in high school, as well Philosophy courses such as PHIL0080 and PHIL0360.\nRespondents praised Professor Susan Bernstein and Professor Marc Redfield as a great teaching team. Specifically, they noted that Professor Bernstein provided useful commentary on the readings and that Professor Redfield provided needed context about the authors and readings. Students found them to be responsive to questions, passionate, and knowledgeable. They were said to always encourage collaboration and participation in section. Reviewers found lectures, which were conducted without slides, very helpful in understanding the material. One student suggested that an improvement would be to incorporate more student participation in lectures.\nClass members had to complete readings before every class, some of which could be quite difficult. Additionally, they were required to write weekly reading responses and weekly one-page papers. They also completed a final paper, which was five to seven pages long.\nThe course was described as intense, and it was noted that material could be difficult but worthwhile. Students suggested that others can do well by paying close attention and asking questions.

In particular, this course will ask how assumptions of cultural contact or isolation shape the way society compares and contrasts cross-cultural literature or media such as bringing together a Chinese and Greek poem, or interpreting a documentary film about modern Indonesia. Though there is no official prerequisite, both previous experience with humanities seminars, and general knowledge of East Asian history would better prepare students for this course.\nReviewers praised Professor Tamara Chin's passion for the material and her effective teaching style. Her role as both a lecturer and a moderator allowed students to actively engage in discussion as well as appreciate each other's thoughts on the given topics. Most respondents agreed that Professor Chin was very accessible outside of class, both during office hours and via email. Students also agreed that her feedback was timely and effective.\nThe coursework includes weekly reading responses, a three-page paper, a five-page paper, a group presentation, and a quiz. Though most agreed that the assignments were highly relevant to course goals, some noted that the readings and writings were occasionally overwhelming and challenging, especially for non-concentrators. One student mentioned that the weekly reading responses became particularly hard due to the significant amount of readings assigned.\nMost students had a positive experience in this course and found class discussions especially rewarding. Therefore some suggested that this course meet 2 to 3 times a week so that more in-depth discussions could take place. Reviewers also remarked that a clearer theme or objective outline given at the beginning of class and a chronological approach to the material would help create a more cohesive experience. Students interested in this topic also recommended shopping other 1000 level humanities courses such as \"Introduction to the Theory of Literature\" (COLT 1210), \"Literature and Multilingualism\" (COLT 1610K), and \"Letter of the Law\" (COLT 1814J).\n\ninstructor: Instructors\nTamara Chin\ntamara_chin@brown.edu\n\nschedule: Schedule and Location\nM 3pm-5:30pm in Prospect House 102\n\naverage_hours: 5.90\n\nmax_hours: 10.10\n\ncourse_rating: 76%\n4.76\n\nprofessor_rating: 91%\n4.78\n\nprofessor_and_term: COLT 1310G | Chin, Tamara (S1) | Fall 2016\n\n", "code: COLT 1310J\n\nterm: Spring 2025\n\ntitle: The Arab Renaissance\n\ndescription: \u201cThe Arab Renaissance\u201d (COLT1310J) taught by Professor Elias Muhanna provides wonderful teachings that dive into the Arabic world, language, and history! Reviewers suggested previous knowledge in the Arab language and in the Arab culture as helpful.\nThe professor was found to be engaging and knowledgeable both in and out of the classroom. The classes were centered around student-led discussions and close readings of texts that were often in need of translations. One reviewer noted that sometimes translations took away time from valuable and thought provoking discussion, but this did not seem to be an overwhelming issue. Students agreed that the professor was eager and available to help both in and out of the classroom and held office hours at any time during the semester.\nCourse assignments consisted of weekly translations, a five-page paper, one presentation, and a ten-page final paper.

Incredibly approachable, she made herself readily available outside of class and really took the time to get to know each of her students, requiring them to meet with her at least once during the semester. Respondents found that her enthusiasm for the material translated to general excitement, and her palpable passion helped contribute to spirited discussions.\nThe coursework consisted of two take-home exams, one oral presentation, and a plethora of reading assignments. Some reviewers noted that the assignments were challenging and time-consuming but related well to the course, helping students to explore each novel on a deeper level. Additionally, the assignments aided synthesis of topics learned in class to connect various ideas together.

Taught by Professors Kathi Fisler and Milda Zizyte, the course is designed for both CS concentrators and non-concentrators who want to step into the field of data and computing. It features smaller-scale assignments that are comparatively more \u201cgentle\u201d than other intro sequence courses, such as CSCI 0170 or CSCI 0150. The course does not have any prerequisites and does not require any prior coding experience.\nThe teaching styles of both instructors were found to be generally effective. The respondents thought the professors were approachable, accommodating, and passionate about the class which made attending lectures enjoyable. Professor Fisler's \u201chumming\u201d method\u2014where the professor would ask students to hum instead of raising their hand in response to classwide questions\u2014was particularly helpful in allowing students to give immediate feedback. However, some respondents believed that example questions that are provided in class often are not useful since there is a significant \u201cleap in difficulty\u201d between homework and lecture material. Generally, students heavily recommended the use of TA hours to supplement lectures and resolve confusion but warned that the long queues meant that assignments can take days to finish.\nCoursework for \u201cComputing Foundations: Data\u201d included seven homework assignments, group and individual projects, weekly labs, two weekly quizzes, a take-home midterm, and an in-person final exam. Students had mixed responses on the grading scheme of the course, with some stating that one simply needs to put in the work and go to office hours to perform well and others believing that the opaque and sometimes untested auto graders created frustration.\nOverall, the respondents noted that TA hours were extremely helpful, and using EdStem was very important in understanding the course material and getting questions answered about the assignments.

The course teaches students object-oriented programming, as well as basic functional and imperative programming concepts. Students explore how the organization of programs, data, and algorithms affects metrics such as time performance, space, and data privacy. Students can expect to leave this course with knowledge about how to choose between candidate data structures when approaching a problem, experience writing programs over several standard data structures, the ability to assess the quality of programs from multiple perspectives, and skills they can apply to a wide variety of computational problems. It is important to note that this course does have \"Computing Foundations: Data\u201d (CSCI0111) as a prerequisite, and that previous students suggested that experience coding in Python would be helpful.\nStudents praised Professor Nelson, highlighting his clear passion for the material and ability to engage students in lectures. Students consistently lauded the usefulness of in-class drills and his flexibility during discussion and lecture, which allowed students to tune the class to their interests. Students also appreciated that Professor Nelson showed interest in their studies outside of CS, describing him as a \u201cnice guy who cares about his students and is very enthusiastic about what he is teaching.\u201d\nAssignments for CSCI0112 consisted of weekly labs, three group projects, a few drills on Gradescope graded for completion, and weekly coding assignments on weeks where no projects were assigned. The class culminated in a final project that students could complete as a group or individually. Reviewers expressed that the overall workload was quite manageable, especially compared to other intro CS classes, and that the TAs and Professor Nelson provided ample assistance to students with homework problems and provided helpful guidance for projects.\nAll in all, the majority of reviewers enjoyed taking CSCI0112. Some reviewers did note that some of the more specific lectures, such as one on how Python works, may be interesting, but not helpful to non-concentrators.

Although many students found that no background was required, they found that some found that it would be good to know some basic programming concepts to adjust to the fast-paced, work-heavy course.\nThe reviews for the instructor were overall positive. Students praised Professor Andries \u2018Andy\u2019 van Dam for his clear passion for the course. They also found entertainment in the short skits that kept them engaged in the classes. Though students felt that the speed of the lecture was fast, they felt that it was necessary because of the large amount of content covered throughout the semester. The students noted that labs and TA hours were especially helpful in reinforcing the concepts taught in the lecture as Andy would often not be available for assistance.\nIn terms of assignments, there were eight individual projects (counting the final project), two group projects, and weekly lab assignments.

In fact, reviewers note that it could be a hindrance to know about computer science as it approaches the field through a different perspective.\nStudents had mixed reviews about the effectiveness of the instructor\u2019s teaching methods. They praised Professor John F. \"Spike\" Hughes for his genuine passion and use of in-class examples and demonstrations. However, they also noted that his lecture was a mix of \u201cmeticulous detail on unimportant things\u201d and brevity on important things. For the content that wasn\u2019t addressed sufficiently in lecture, students found the labs and homework to be helpful in filling in the gaps.\nIn this course, there are weekly homework and lab assignments, three group projects, and a take-home exam. Students found the assignments to be time-consuming and conceptually difficult but rewarding. On these assignments, many praised the TAs for being helpful in answering questions and breaking down the problem. On average, students spent multiple hours a week outside of class and also attended weekly two-hour labs as a part of the course.\nOverall, students found this course to be rigorous \u201cbut the learning is unparalleled.\u201d It is very important to pay attention to the details in this class. One piece of advice for prospective students is to prepare well for the final exam as it is difficult. More importantly, having a strong grasp on time management is described as crucial for succeeding in this class.\n\ninstructor: Instructors\nPhilip Klein\nphilip_klein@brown.edu\n\nschedule: Schedule and Location\nMW 3pm-4:20pm in Barus & Holley 166\n\naverage_hours: 10.30\n\nmax_hours: 26.43\n\ncourse_rating: 36%\n3.91\n\nprofessor_rating: 55%\n4.10\n\nprofessor_and_term: CSCI 0170 | Hughes, John (S1) | Fall 2022\n\n", "code: CSCI 0190\n\nterm: Fall 2024\n\ntitle: Accelerated Introduction to Computer Science\n\ndescription: \u201cAccelerated Introduction to Computer Science\u201d (CSCI0190), taught by Professor Shriram Krishnamurthi, is an introductory-level computer science course that covers core data structures, algorithms, and analysis techniques. The course is part of the computer science intro sequence acting as a replacement for other sequences which require two courses. Students mentioned that no substantial background was needed to ultimately succeed in the course, but a foundational understanding of computing was helpful. There is no official prerequisite for the class \u2013 however, several online placement exams must be passed before enrollment in the course over the summer.\nStudents mentioned that they appreciated Professor Shriram\u2019s enthusiastic and engaging teaching style. They thought that his lecture format was effective in creating a collaborative learning environment. Some lectures were a bit slow, but most were entertaining and worthwhile to attend. Beginners characterized Professor Shriram as a great professor for newcomers to computer science.\nMany students mentioned that course material could be difficult and the workload could be heavy. One student said that it is important to \u201cbe able to manage your time well in order to not get overwhelmed.\u201d Homework frequency varied throughout the semester. There were roughly seven labs total, a few optional readings, and homework very often (every two days to one week). Homework made up the bulk of the workload in the course.\nOverall, students had many positive reviews for the course. The course was described as difficult and required time management skills, but beginners will find success if they put in the work. As the course is accelerated, a background in computer science is helpful, especially in the first couple of weeks.\n\ninstructor: Instructors\nShriram Krishnamurthi\nshriram_krishnamurthi@brown.edu\n\nschedule: Schedule and Location\nMWF 9am-9:50am in CIT Center (Thomas Watson CIT) 368\n\naverage_hours: 10.70\n\nmax_hours: 17.67\n\ncourse_rating: 54%\n4.05\n\nprofessor_rating: 75%\n4.68\n\nprofessor_and_term: CSCI 0190 | Krishnamurthi, Shriram (S1) | Fall 2023\n\n", "code: CSCI 0200\n\nterm: Fall 2024\n\ntitle: Program Design with Data Structures and Algorithms\n\ndescription: If you\u2019re planning to take your computer science education beyond an intro course, \u201cProgram Design with Data Structures and Algorithms\u201d (CSCI0200) is almost certainly your next stop. The course is designed to be a general continuation of the work done in all introductory courses, further building up students\u2019 ability to manage more complex structures computationally. The course has CSCI0112, CS0150, CS0170, and CS0190 as prerequisites, although students with only CSCI0111 may also enroll following the completion of some additional work. Most respondents stated that they had either CS0150 or CS0170 as their only computer science background.\nThe course was co-taught by professors Kathi Fisler and Nicholas DeMarinis. Both instructors were routinely described as passionate and effective by reviewers, often alternating between written digital notes, diagrams, and code to explain concepts. Students noted that the professors were able to promote discussion and participation despite the large class size, keeping instruction engaging as they worked through various problems. Respondents noted that some classes moved slower than they would\u2019ve liked and that lectures often felt disconnected from the work being done outside of the classroom, but that lectures were still worth attending to better understand the more complicated subjects the course covers.\nCoursework consisted of weekly lab sections, six homework assignments, two group projects, and two in-person exams. Reviewers tended to find the homework especially time-consuming, and many complained of not getting exam and homework grades back in a timely manner to respond to feedback or understand their position in the course. The work was found to be somewhat more challenging than what students were exposed to in their intro courses and a substantial portion of the learning in the course comes from this work. Multiple respondents mentioned that the bulk of the difficulty for the course seems to appear in the first half of the semester, and recommended students work early and often on these assignments to keep up.\nStudents overall found CSCI0200 to be a challenging, but helpful continuation of their CS education. While the course was time-intensive and struggled with administering grades, most found that the learning they gained from both the lectures and homework was enough to leave a positive impression. Many reviewers advised to only take the course if a student is planning to concentrate in computer science and that prospective students should plan to make the course a priority if they wish to succeed.\n\ninstructor: Instructors\nNicholas DeMarinis\nnicholas_demarinis@brown.edu\n\nschedule: Schedule and Location\nMWF 2pm-2:50pm in CIT Center (Thomas Watson CIT) 165\n\naverage_hours: 8.74\n\nmax_hours: 15.47\n\ncourse_rating: 32%\n3.44\n\nprofessor_rating: 55%\n4.17\n\nprofessor_and_term: CSCI 0200 | Fisler, Kathi (S1) | Spring 2023\n\n", "code: CSCI 0220\n\nterm: Spring 2025\n\ntitle: Introduction to Discrete Structures and Probability\n\ndescription: \u201cIntroduction to Discrete Structures and Probability\u201d (CSCI0220) introduces the most common structures of computer science, illustrates proof techniques, and introduces basic concepts in computational and probability theory. Topics such as Boolean algebra, logic, set theory, elements of algebraic structures, graph theory, combinatorics, and probability are covered in CSCI0220. There are no official prerequisites for this course, though some students found that background knowledge of probability and classes like \u201cStatistical Inference I\u201d (APMA1650) were helpful.\nProfessor Robert Lewis was described as a passionate instructor who was generally accessible during office hours. However, many students pointed out that his lectures could become dry and were not always relevant to the assignments or exams, leading to confusion among students. In addition, several students noted that they would have preferred Professor Lewis\u2019 lecture style to be more interactive rather than relying mainly on lecture slides. According to several responses, attending the recitation sessions was a key component to success in CSCI0220.\nAssignments for this course included ten weekly problem sets, one midterm, and a final exam. Students emphasized the generally high difficulty of the course\u2019s content, which was reflected in the assignments and on the exams. Additionally, students agreed that lectures tended to be more in-depth than the content that was tested on the exams.\nOverall, students found CSCI0220 to be an essential class to take as an introduction to proofs and logic, as well as some statistics. Although students appreciated Professor Lewis\u2019 passion for the material, many found the lectures fast-paced and suggested providing lecture notes as a supplement. While some students warned that this class is very theoretical and may not suit the interests of non-concentrators, others found that they were successful despite not having a background in the area.\n\ninstructor: Instructors\nRobert Lewis\nrobert_lewis@brown.edu\nEllis Hershkowitz\nellis_hershkowitz@brown.edu\n\nschedule: Schedule and Location\nMWF 1pm-1:50pm Location TBD\n\naverage_hours: 4.35\n\nmax_hours: 7.61\n\ncourse_rating: 35%\n3.76\n\nprofessor_rating: 57%\n4.26\n\nprofessor_and_term: CSCI 0220 | Lewis, Robert (S1) | Spring 2023\n\n", "code: CSCI 0300\n\nterm: Spring 2025\n\ntitle: Fundamentals of Computer Systems\n\ndescription: \"Fundamentals of Computer Systems\" (CSCI0300) covers the fundamental concepts in the design of computer systems, including machine organization, systems programming and performance, isolation, security, virtualization and concurrent programming. It also touches on the basics of operating systems and distributed systems. The prerequisites for this course are the introductory computer science sequence, which most respondents agreed was sufficient for succeeding in the course. Some background in C or C++ programming or hardware was also noted to be useful.\nRespondents said that Professor Malte Schwarzkopf was extremely approachable and respectful\u2014and knew almost everyone's name in the 200+ person class! They appreciated his engaging lecturing style and the way he would frequently pause to respond to questions or draw on the board. Additionally, the anonymous question made it easy for students to ask questions in a large lecture hall.\nAssignments include short quizzes after every lecture, six programming projects, and six labs. There was also a midterm and a final exam.\nThe projects were split into stages where students could run a test suite to check their implementations. Respondents stated that the projects tested their critical thinking and could be conceptually difficult to understand, but the help received in TA hours made it much more manageable.\nOverall, respondents agreed that CSCI0300 is a time-consuming and difficult course, but definitely worth the effort. One student even said that it helped them get over a fear of low-level systems and hardware.

Students found this background helpful, and some noted that previous familiarity with React helped during the frontend development portion of the course.\nRespondents felt that Professor Tim Nelson was passionate and attentive to the students\u2019 needs, but noted that his lectures tended to lack structure and were often not relevant to the projects. During lecture, Tim often prompted small discussion and would rearrange the agenda in order to answer more student questions. Some respondents felt that this made lecture hard to follow, but noted that Tim was very helpful during office hours and open to feedback.\nAssignments included weekly optional readings, one individual project, and five group projects. Because the link between lecture and the assignments was not always clear, much of the learning was done through projects. Some students found this to be a frustrating experience. During project coding weeks, students spent an average of 15-20 hours working on the projects. Workload was much lighter during reflection weeks.\nOverall, students found the course rewarding as it provided a lot of insight into software engineering projects. However, CSCI0320 is very time consuming and requires significant effort, and students agreed that the course felt \u201cself taught\u201d and more was learned from doing rather than listening.

Students generally agreed that CSCI1250 taught them everything they needed for the course. Students who have equivalent experience should submit a portfolio for admittance, although one respondent said that students would need a lot of experience beforehand to succeed in the course. Some respondents added that taking a few visual arts and design courses was also helpful.\nRespondents overwhelmingly praised Professor Barbara Meier for her effective critiquing style: honest, straightforward, personalized, and encouraging. Although she occasionally lectured during class, one respondent said that most of the technical learning came through online tutorials that students could follow at their own pace. Although some students struggled with this setup, others appreciated that it allowed the class to focus more on the \"artistic side\" of animation during class meetings.\nAssignments include five individual projects and a self-directed final project. The individual projects involve designing, rigging, and animating a character, outdoor lighting, procedural shading, dynamics and simulation, and VFX compositing. They generally spanned around two weeks and had both an in-progress and a final deadline. The final project was a polished, portfolio-quality piece of the student's choosing.\nOverall, respondents agreed that CSCI1280 was an intense but highly rewarding class, especially for students interested in animation or VFX. As a seminar course of less than twenty students, students appreciated the \"fun, relaxed, atmosphere\" and the \"very close-knit animation community.\" In the words of one enthusiastic respondent: \"If you love animation, drop everything and take this class!!\"\n\ninstructor: Instructors\nBarbara Meier\nbarbara_meier@brown.edu\n\nschedule: Schedule and Location\nMW 12pm-1:50pm Location TBD\n\naverage_hours: 10.75\n\nmax_hours: 40.00\n\ncourse_rating: 63%\n4.72\n\nprofessor_rating: 80%\n5.00\n\nprofessor_and_term: CSCI 1280 | Meier, Barbara (S1) | Spring 2023\n\n", "code: CSCI 1300\n\nterm: Spring 2025\n\ntitle: User Interfaces and User Experience\n\ndescription: \u201cUser Interfaces and User Experience\u201d (CSCI 1300) taught by Professor Jeff Huang is a class that teaches \u201cwhen to use different interfaces, modeling and representing user interaction, principles of user experience design, eliciting requirements and feedback from users, methods for designing and prototyping interfaces, and user interface evaluation.\u201d Most students had prior experience with computer science courses at Brown or web design courses at RISD, and several mentioned that familiarity with HTML, React, and JavaScript was helpful.\nStudents universally described Jeff as very humorous and passionate. They expressed enjoying his lectures which were casual and interesting, despite the occasional tangent and lack of participation from students. Several students wrote that too much time was spent on seminar-style discussions, which was not effective for the class size, and recommended focusing more on lecturing. Jeff was also applauded for giving excellent and extensive feedback on assignments. Outside of class, students noted that Jeff\u2019s office hours were frequently busy, but if students were patient enough to get the chance to sit down and talk with him, he was great to discuss CS courses or career advice with.\nThe coursework consisted of three labs, six projects, a final portfolio, and weekly readings at the beginning of the semester that phased out to biweekly readings. Students frequently remarked that although assignments were decently relevant and easy (especially towards the beginning of the semester), they were also tedious and time-consuming, with a couple of students describing it as busy-work. Several students expressed appreciation for the flexibility and creativity that the projects offered as well as for the group-work, recommending assigning more of the latter. Several students also hoped for more assignments that incorporated coding. A number of respondents expressed frustration with the grading policy, asking for more clarity on the matter, with a couple students feeling that the grading rubric unfairly attempted to assign points based on subjective judgments. Several people noted that the course layout could be improved, for example with PDFs automatically opening in a new tab, as well as more concise handouts that condense important information.\nStudents agreed that this course is unlike any other CS course at Brown, covering very different material from the typical CS class. This is an easy class for students who wish to explore the intersection between design and computer science. This course was noteworthy and unique to students in a variety of ways, including the variety of backgrounds of people taking the course, the use of dating websites as examples of user interfaces, and how quality designs are rarely appreciated or noticed. Overall, students loved the professor\u2019s sense of humor. While there are few other courses at Brown similar to this one, students recommend shopping CSCI1320 \u201cWeb Development\u201d and CSCI2300.\n\ninstructor: Instructors\nJeff Huang\njeff_huang@brown.edu\n\nschedule: Schedule and Location\nTTh 1pm-2:20pm Location TBD\n\naverage_hours: 5.43\n\nmax_hours: 11.39\n\ncourse_rating: 59%\n3.71\n\nprofessor_rating: 82%\n4.58\n\nprofessor_and_term: CSCI 1300 | Huang, Jeff (S1) | Fall 2019\n\n", "code: CSCI 1310\n\nterm: Spring 2025\n\ntitle: Fundamentals of Computer Systems\n\ndescription: \u201cFundamentals of Computer Systems\u201d (CSCI1310), is a graduate-level course covering the fundamentals of designing and engineering computer systems. Students were quick to state that familiarity with C++ was particularly helpful but not integral to success in the class. Enrollment in this course is limited to graduate computer science students but otherwise requires no official prerequisites.\nProfessor Malte Schwarzkopf was praised for his energetic and innovative teaching style. Rather than organizing course materials on slides and going over them in class, Professor Malte preferred to run sample code during class that directly applied that day\u2019s material. Malte guided students through the logic and bugs of the code while running it in real-time, which respondents found particularly engaging. Reviewers also praised his openness to questions. An anonymous online bubble system allowed students to ask questions without judgment and Professor Malte was great at setting aside specific time in lectures to answer these questions.\nThe course consisted of post-lecture quizzes, two in-class exams, six labs, and five projects with some projects containing group work components. The language used for programming assignments was either C or C++. Respondents felt the workload could be heavy but that instructions on assignments were very detailed and that TAs were very helpful in completing them.\nOverall, students deeply valued this course. Respondents noted that the material and assignments - although sometimes challenging - were very relevant. Prospective students were encouraged to attend lectures regularly as each lecture's content builds on material covered in previous lectures. While they noted the workload was heavy, support from Professor Malte himself, as well as a strong team of TAs, made success in the course achievable even without a background in the used programming languages.\n\ninstructor: Instructors\nNicholas DeMarinis\nnicholas_demarinis@brown.edu\n\nschedule: Schedule and Location\nCourse offered online\n\nprograms: Curricular Programs\nAccessible to Remote Students (REM)\n\naverage_hours: 19.00\n\nmax_hours: 30.00\n\ncourse_rating: 62%\n4.67\n\nprofessor_rating: 67%\n5.00\n\nprofessor_and_term: CSCI 1310 | Schwarzkopf, Malte (S1) | Spring 2023\n\n", "code: CSCI 1330\n\nterm: Fall 2024\n\ntitle: Computer Systems\n\ndescription: \u201cComputer Systems\u201d (CSCI1330) covers the basics of computer systems through the lens of assembly-language and C-language programming.

Extensive programming exercises introduced students to systems-level programming on Unix systems and multi-threaded programming with POSIX threads. Many respondents indicated that an introductory computer science course was crucial for success in this course. Reviewers also found prior experience in C helpful, although not necessary for succeeding in the class. This course is the graduate version of the course CSCI0330, with the only difference being additional weekly homework for the graduate-level class.\nIn general, students appreciated Professor Thomas Doeppner\u2019s passion for the content, organized material, and responsiveness to questions. However, some respondents found the amount of content per class dense, especially with time allotted for student engagement via Tophat, open-ended questions for students to process on their own, and occasional in-class quizzes. Overall, reviewers' opinion was that lectures were content-rich, but there was ample opportunity to ask questions if the material was unclear.\nCourse requirements for CSCI1330 included weekly homework assignments, weekly two-hour labs, and approximately nine projects. Homework assignments were released at the end of the week and were expected to be completed by the end of the following week. The CSCI1330 weekly homework accounted for 10% of the grade, with the rest being divided among normal CSCI0330 projects, labs, and in-class participation. Labs consisted of weekly, two-hour sessions, which could be completed with a partner. Projects were released biweekly and were more strenuous, with many students advising to start them early.\nOverall, reviewers found the course to be time-consuming but rewarding. Many found the difficult nature of the course balanced by the strong course organization and resources. Respondents also suggested befriending peers, as collaboration with fellow students was another resource allowed in the course. Students also suggested a similar spring course that covers equivalent material at a higher level, CSCI0300 (Fundamentals Of Computer Systems), which does not go into as much depth on some of the lower-level concepts. In general, many reviewers were satisfied with the class and found the course material foundational for certain upper-level CS electives.\n\ninstructor: Instructors\nThomas Doeppner\nthomas_doeppner_jr@brown.edu\nNicholas DeMarinis\nnicholas_demarinis@brown.edu\n\nschedule: Schedule and Location\nMWF 2pm-2:50pm in Salomon Center 001\n\naverage_hours: 12.33\n\nmax_hours: 25.00\n\ncourse_rating: 62%\n4.67\n\nprofessor_rating: 66%\n4.94\n\nprofessor_and_term: CSCI 1330 | Doeppner, Thomas (S1) | Fall 2023\n\n", "code: CSCI 1340\n\nterm: Fall 2024\n\ntitle: Introduction to Software Engineering\n\ndescription: The goal of \"Innovating Game Development\" was to create a functional game that uses an \"innovative technology.\" Students said that strong programming skills were needed.

Due to the stellar instruction and interesting assignments, reviewers found the course extremely interesting and rewarding, recommending it to anyone with an interest in cryptography.\n\ninstructor: Instructors\nPeihan Miao\npeihan_miao@brown.edu\n\nschedule: Schedule and Location\nTTh 10:30am-11:50am in CIT Center (Thomas Watson CIT) 477\n\nprograms: Curricular Programs\nAccessible to Remote Students (REM)\n\naverage_hours: 10.57\n\nmax_hours: 18.14\n\ncourse_rating: 62%\n4.66\n\nprofessor_rating: 67%\n5.00\n\nprofessor_and_term: CSCI 1510 | Miao, Peihan (S1) | Fall 2023\n\n", "code: CSCI 1515\n\nterm: Spring 2025\n\ntitle: Applied Cryptography\n\ndescription: \u201cApplied Cryptography\u201d (CSCI1515) is, as one reviewer put it, \u201ccryptography without proofs!\u201d The course takes an applied approach to cryptographic methods in computer science, focusing on how to implement the theories underlying various aspects of cryptography using current tools. The course has a variety of options to fulfill its prerequisite requirements, but most students mentioned a background including CSCI0200, CSCI0220, CSCI0330, and similar courses. Overall, reviewers found that exposure to applied and discrete mathematics, systems, and programming was helpful but that nothing was essential beyond the prerequisites.\nProfessor Peihan Miao received universal praise from respondents. Students found Professor Miao to be incredibly enthusiastic and passionate about the material which shaped her evident enjoyment of teaching it. Professor Miao\u2019s style of teaching was described by one reviewer as \u201ctruly gifted,\u201d operating at a pace that most students found natural, intuitive, and effective while providing careful and thorough answers to questions posed in class without becoming mired in detail. Students lauded the notes and slides that Miao provided, finding them especially useful and clear in a course where most described the content as otherwise quite dense and \u201cgraduate level.\u201d\nOutside of lectures, work for the course included five written homework assignments and six coding assignments, of which most of the coding assignments could be completed individually or with a partner. Respondents noted that the course heavily emphasized the work done in the programming assignments and that these assignments were easily understandable and completable, even for students without past exposure to the topic. For those with previous background in cryptography, students still found the assignments worthwhile, expressing how the assignments exposed the gaps they had in their knowledge.\nAll reviewers were enthusiastic in recommending the course to any student with even a passing interest in cryptography. Several reviewers underscored that prospective students should not be deterred from the course due to a weak background in mathematics or cryptography and should take the course anyway, which was attributed to how effective Professor Miao was as a lecturer. As one student summarized, \u201cat the end of the course, you'll fall in love with cryptography, be amazed to see the beauty of math, and will start thinking about making a career in this field.\u201d\n\ninstructor: Instructors\nPeihan Miao\npeihan_miao@brown.edu\n\nschedule: Schedule and Location\nTTh 9am-10:20am Location TBD\n\naverage_hours: 6.22\n\nmax_hours: 11.67\n\ncourse_rating: 60%\n4.51\n\nprofessor_rating: 79%\n4.96\n\nprofessor_and_term: CSCI 1515 | Miao, Peihan (S1) | Spring 2023\n\n", "code: CSCI 1550\n\nterm: Spring 2025\n\ntitle: Probabilistic Methods in Computer Science\n\ndescription: *Please note that this course was taught partially online \u2013 this review may not be reflective of future semesters*\n\"Probabilistic Methods in Computer Science\" (CSCI1550) is a course taught by Professor Eliezer Upfal that introduces probabilistic techniques used in computer science applications with an emphasis on randomized algorithms, probabilistic analysis of algorithms, and machine learning. Basic background in probability theory, such as CSCI1450, is a prerequisite for the course. Students said that other useful courses included \"Statistical Inference I\", \"Introduction to Discrete Structures and Probability\", and \"Design and Analysis of Algorithms\".\nStudents mentioned the material was interesting and difficult but praised Professor Upfal for understanding this and going through slides more than once. In addition, Professor Upfal was said to be very receptive to questions and encouraged students to ask about and engage with the material as much as possible. A few reviewers noted that the lectures were a bit dry, and one responder mentioned that the 90-minute lectures did not help with the dense material covered.\nThe coursework consists of weekly problem sets (usually consisting of three problems with multiple parts each) worth 40% of the grade, a take-home midterm worth 20%, and a take-home final exam worth 40%. The midterm and final were both noted to have a week to complete them both, and the reviewer also said that the midterm was very difficult, but found the final to be a lot easier. Students said that homework was extremely difficult but very worth it as they were incredibly useful and valuable.\nOverall, reviewers felt like this course was unique and very mathematically focused. CSCI0220 and APMA1650 were said to be helpful for proof-writing, probability, statistics, and discrete math, while CSCI1570 was more helpful for analyzing the complicated algorithms. Other possible classes to consider are \u201cMachine Learning\u201d (CSCI1420) for more practical programming assignments, \u201cComputer Vision\u201d (CSCI1430), \u201cComputational Probability and Statistics\u201d (APMA1690), and \u201cRecent Applications of Probability and Statistics\u201d (APMA1740).

The prerequisites are an introductory Computer Science sequence and either \u201cIntroduction to Discrete Structures and Probability\u201d (CSCI0220) or \u201cProbability and Computing for Data Analysis\u201d (CSCI1450). Respondents generally believed that those prerequisites were sufficient, though several also recommended taking \u201cLinear Algebra\u201d (MATH0520) first for the proofs.\nProfessor Paul Valiant was praised as a passionate and engaging instructor who cared deeply about his students. Respondents described him as incredibly dedicated and thoughtful, and many explained how he devoted much of his time to helping students outside of class. He was enthusiastic about the material, and students found his explanations to be effective. However, many described him as being confusing and disorganized at times, and that he sometimes lost his focus during lectures. Students also indicated that while Professor Valiant wanted everyone to understand the material, he sometimes breezed over specifics needed for problem sets.\nAssignments for this course included weekly problem sets, an individual presentation, a team contest, a midterm, and a final. Students found the problem sets to be challenging and time-intensive, but several mentioned that they were manageable when working with a partner. Many noted that understanding homeworks was integral to their success, and that TA hours were an invaluable resource. Students taking the course for one-and-a-half credit had five problems per homework, while those taking it for one credit had three problems. The highlight of the class for many was the team contest.\nOverall, students largely enjoyed this course, commending how the class vastly advanced their understanding of algorithms. To improve the course, respondents suggested that lectures be more organized, problem sets be more focused, and resources be released sooner. Respondents recommended taking \u201cIntroduction to Discrete Structures and Probability\u201d (CSCI0220) first in order to come into the class with a solid foundation in proofs.

Respondents noted that having taken CSCI0330, in particular, was especially helpful.\nStudents largely agreed that Professor Milda Zizyte was very informative and well-organized. Respondents also felt that she was very responsive to student feedback, especially about time commitments and personal difficulties, and willing to make changes in the class accordingly. One problem that most of the respondents agreed on was the 2.5-hour length of the class, which many felt made it difficult to stay engaged even though Professor Zizyte encouraged student discussion.\nAssignments for the course include weekly readings and accompanying textbook exercises. Students are also sometimes asked to research events related to embedded systems. There are also weekly lab sections, which respondents felt were rewarding because they offered students hands-on experience with embedded devices. Some felt that the pre-labs that accompany these sections could be lengthy and frustrating at times. There is also a final group project which is largely in the creative hands of the students. Respondents also noted that Professor Zizyte graded on effort rather than accuracy, which encouraged them to grow as students.\nOverall, students felt that this was a fun class that offered a comprehensive overview of embedded systems\u2014though it does not go too in-depth.

CSCI1620 is intended to be taken concurrently with CSCI1660. The official prerequisites for CSCI1620 are either \u201cComputer Systems Security\u201d (CSCI1951E) or \u201cIntroduction to Computer Systems Security\u201d (CSCI1660), which may be taken concurrently. Students found previous experience with web- and systems-related courses such as CSCI0320 and CSCI0330 to be helpful as well.\nProfessor Bernardo Palazzi often had the HTAs and Graduate TAs help to teach the lectures. Students found the integration of HTS and Graduate TAs refreshing and useful, especially considering some respondents thought Professor Palazzi could be difficult to understand during lectures. One student mentioned that the course required some self-teaching in order to fully understand the concepts.\nAssignments included readings, three individual projects, one group project, four reading responses/Canvas posts, and two take-home exams. Students said these assignments were difficult, but overall found the course content fascinating. Final numerical grades were determined using the following weighting system: Homework assignments (24%), Midterm 1 (12%), Midterm 2 (16%), Project 1 (11%), Project 2 (11%), Project 3 (11%), and Project 4 (11%).\nUltimately, students enjoyed \"Computer Systems Security Lab.\" Despite the course's difficulty, respondents felt that they learned a lot in the course.

However, students also found that knowledge of low-level programming and the Linux shell was useful coming into the course.\nStudents generally agreed that Professor Vasilis Kemerlis was passionate and knowledgeable about the subject. They also found that he was patient with questions and loved discussing student answers in office hours. Students appreciated how Professor Kemerlis incorporated theory, demonstrations, and computer science history into his lectures. Some students felt, however, that the handwritten lecture slides and the notes could be hard to navigate. Additionally, there were mixed opinions about the pacing of the course: some students thought that lectures could be slow at times, while others thought that the lecture moved through certain steps too quickly.\nAssignments include four capture-the-flag (CTF) assignments and many readings. In the CTFs, students are asked to trigger and exploit bugs in a set of vulnerable binaries. Students said that these assignments were time-consuming but rewarding. There are no exams, labs, or final projects.\nOn the whole, students appreciated that the course was relatively \u201cchill\u201d and \u201crelaxing.\u201d One respondent said that this was the \u201cbest class to get into security.\u201d Another respondent argued that the course had a narrow focus on a specific set of security issues that they believed \u201clargely doesn\u2019t apply to real-world use.\u201d Respondents advised that students start early and scrub through the lecture captures as they do the assignments.

It is also noted as a relevant course in the Security path. Students must have one of the following prerequisites to take this course: CSCI0300, CSCI0330, CSCI1310, or CSCI1330. Most respondents however agreed that CSCI0330 was the most useful one for this class.\nProfessor Thomas Doeppner used PowerPoint lecture slides during his class, and was described as being extremely efficient but a little dry at times. Despite not being very engaging, he made the content extremely detailed, informative, and interesting. He taught in a structured and calm way, but it occasionally did not align with the very specific homework assignments.\nThe workload for CSCI1670 was composed of four homework assignments, each being 10% of the final grade, and also four short programming assignments, each being 12.5% of the final grade. The final 10% was from in-class TopHat quizzes. The programming assignments in particular were deemed to be difficult and very time-intensive but extremely rewarding.\nOverall, this class was described as difficult but useful. It developed both theoretical understanding of operating systems but also more practical skills in writing successful code. It was advised that students should already have some interest in systems programming, because that should fuel them with tackling the heavy workload.

The lectures had ample time for dialogue between students and introduced fascinating topics that students had never thought of before. However, respondents felt it could be a little slow-paced at times, due to the time to reflect on new concepts. Students did enjoy that the class was less focused on passively reading off the slides, and more about actively engaging with live coding examples.\nCSCI1730 was described as \u201cfresh,\u201d a class that had a wide variety of assignments, and no exams. None of the homework assignments required a lot of coding, however, all of them were thought-provoking and required time to think over each question. There were nine analysis assignments that involved responding to and experimenting with readings, seven assignments at the beginning of the course that introduced the basic mechanics of programming languages, seven assignments that required students to find and describe the differences between a few programming languages, and eight implementation projects. This amounted to a hefty number of assignments, however, none of them took a large amount of time and were described as being \u201cstraightforward\u201d with the help of lectures and the textbook.\nCSCI1730 was described by students as a useful class.

This class was student-run, meaning that the main instructors were TAs.\nStudents felt that the TAs sometimes rushed through material, and that more time should have been spent on preparing lecture materials. However, some respondents appreciated the TAs' excitement for the course material, and felt that they explained concepts clearly. There were also mixed feelings about TA hours, with respondents evenly split on whether they were helpful. There was consensus on feedback, where all felt the TAs were slow in responding to questions.\nAssignments for this course included weekly homework assignments that included functionality requirements for both the game and game engine as well as a final group project. Students felt the assignments were relevant and useful but also difficult and very time-consuming. Overall, respondents spent fifteen to thirty five hours on this class.\nOverall, students felt that while the course required a lot of work, they enjoyed it nonetheless. One said they felt like they \u201cwrote [...] 80k lines of code.\u201d Due to the time-consuming nature of the course, respondents advised against taking other difficult classes at the same time and encouraged future students to start assignments early. Respondents felt the course could be improved by having more timely grading, clearer guidelines, and slightly easier requirements so they could spend time making the games more fun.

The prerequisite for this course is a first semester introduction sequence to coding (CSCI0111, CSCI0150, CSCI0170, CSCI0190, CLPS0950 or CLPS1292). Students also found it helpful to have some knowledge of statistics and a basic understanding of Python but stressed that these were not essential for success in the class.\nStudents found Professor Linda Clark to be an effective lecturer, though some took issue with the choice of software used to structure lecture. The lectures were given using Prismia, which respondents said required an adjustment to get used to and could be hard to follow due to the high concentration of text and fast-paced switching between topics. They did appreciate Professor Clark's general structure, coding an example followed by the class working on a similar example themselves with close instruction. Students appreciated Professor Clark\u2019s depth of knowledge on the material and friendly demeanor as well as the availability of and level of feedback from the course TA staff.\nThe coursework for DATA0200 included one semester long group data project, four individual response papers chronicling the progress of said project, weekly group discussion posts about project progress, and weekly coding homework assignments in Python. There were also optional supplemental readings each week. Students felt that the homework assignments were where they really cemented their learning but noted that multiple assignments were often due on the same day, which could make the workload feel heavier than it actually was.\nOverall, respondents found this course to be interesting and applicable to their interests in statistics and computing. They stressed that future students will get out what they put into this course, citing the enormous amount of resources available for those who want to delve deeper into the subject. Students also encouraged starting on assignments early as there is a strict policy against late work.\n\ninstructor: Instructors\nLinda Clark\nlinda_clark@brown.edu\n\nschedule: Schedule and Location\nTTh 1pm-2:20pm Location TBD\n\naverage_hours: 3.96\n\nmax_hours: 8.15\n\ncourse_rating: 34%\n3.59\n\nprofessor_rating: 62%\n4.14\n\nprofessor_and_term: DATA 0200 | Clark, Linda (S1) | Spring 2023\n\n", "code: DATA 0250\n\nterm: Winter 2025\n\ntitle: Applied Statistics in Python\n\ndescription: As more students engage in data science there is a need to provide guidance on conducting basic statistical analysis in Python.

But what is machine learning, really? \u201cMachine Learning: from Theory to Algorithms\u201d (DATA2060) aims to answer exactly that question. The course covers the mathematical theory behind machine learning as well as how to use different computational methods and implement different models in Python from scratch. Though primarily filled with Data Science Master\u2019s students, the course is open to other students as well. Official prerequisites were DATA1030, APMA1690, or equivalent, and most students mentioned that DATA1030 was useful preparation, in that it gave respondents background in Python and basic machine learning techniques.\nProfessor Andras Zsom was praised for his effective teaching methods. Students noted that his lectures, which were slide-based, were engaging and interactive, and found that he gave useful examples and intuition. Students noted that there were opportunities for small-group discussion, and appreciated the in-class quizzes that tested their understanding and checked attendance.\nCoursework included weekly problem sets with coding and short response questions, an individual final project, an in-class final exam, and suggested readings. The final project included a short report and in-class presentation. Most students spent between five and ten hours on the course during average weeks, and anywhere between five and twenty hours during the busiest weeks. One student noted that the course\u2019s overall time commitment was fairly low, so it could be a good course to take for students with other time-consuming courses or activities.\nOverall, students found the course to be a useful way to learn about machine learning. Students noted the importance of having a solid background in Python and in relevant areas of mathematics (such as probability), but also praised that the course did not require significant computer science experience. One student noted that \u201cMachine Learning\u201d (CSCI1420) covers similar content, but goes more into depth about machine learning\u2019s mathematical underpinnings.

This course has no official prerequisites, however, students noted that some background knowledge on Japanese history and writing skills from high school were both useful.\nProfessor Kerry Smith was praised for creating an inviting and student-led space during class. Students noted that Professor Smith would allow students to dominate discussions, but would effectively facilitate the discussion by asking interesting questions and introducing new materials when needed. Additionally, students mentioned that Professor Smith seemed intimidating at first, but visiting him during office hours revealed his helpfulness and kindness. Although Professor Smith\u2019s feedback on papers was described as useful, some students did wish they had more of an explanation regarding the grades they recieved.\nAssignments for this course included weekly reading assignments which were then discussed during the one time the class met during the week. There were also weekly pre-discussion writing assignments, four essay opportunities, of which only two were graded, as well as a final project, which, for many students, was a research paper. Students noted that every class was discussion based, but some classes had more lackluster discussions due to some readings being hard to incorporate into discussions.\nOverall, students highly recommended others to take this course. Although there was a large amount of reading, students noted that the academic articles and ideas they were exposed to allowed them to dive deeper into a specific area of history.

By examining the categories of courtesan (entertainers), concubines (secondary consorts), and wives, we will see how the Chinese gender system evolved over time. We will examine how the gender system was both shaped by other social and cultural phenomena and in turn impacted other aspects of culture and society. The course follows a roughly chronological trajectory: each section of the course will be devoted to a particular set of historical issues that was particularly salient in that period. We will examine how gender relations intersected with philosophical ideals, political agendas, religious values, and economic developments, and how individuals navigated the gender system to construct meaningful lives.\n\ninstructor: Instructors\nBeverly Bossler\nbeverly_bossler@brown.edu\n\nschedule: Schedule and Location\nTTh 9am-10:20am Location TBD\n\nprograms: Curricular Programs\nRace, Power, and Privilege (RPP)\nWriting - Designated Courses (WRIT)\n\ncritical_review_url: http://www.thecriticalreview.org/EAST/0309\n\n", "code: EAST 0535\n\nterm: Fall 2024\n\ntitle: Korean Popular Culture\n\ndescription: This course critically engages with Korean popular culture in order to explore how an arena often dismissed as \u201cmere entertainment\u201d can act as an indicator of cultural values and a producer of cultural meaning. It treats works of popular culture as important economic, political, and social texts and asks us to reflect on how the production and consumption of popular culture shapes, and is shaped by, our lived experiences. Put another way, this course explores what popular culture says about society and, conversely, what society says about popular culture. Investigating diverse cultural forms, such as television, film, music, sports, advertising, and the Internet, we will struggle with the meaning of popular culture and its place in Korean society, both historically and within contemporary moments.

Its focus is on Mandarin, in particular the development of Chinese characters along with the development of civilization in China. It has no prerequisites, but reviewers strongly suggest having a background in Chinese language or history, or having taken Introduction to Linguistics (CLPS0300).\nProfessor Li lectured for the majority of class meetings. Several students reported that the lectures aligned with the readings well and were especially helpful in conjunction with dense readings. However, a number of reviewers complained that the lack of structure in presentations made them difficult to follow and thus difficult to maintain interest in. Some also felt that, since this was a two-and-a-half hour class, more group discussion was absolutely necessary to break up an otherwise long lecture. With regards to seeking help outside of class, students wrote that Professor Li was easy to contact and gave good feedback to their questions.\nReadings were assigned weekly for this course, along with a one-page response. There was a midterm as well as a final presentation and ten-page paper. Many students referred to the readings as dense, but nearly everyone found them to be valuable resources on the subject of this course. Students felt that assignments were fair, with the midterm perhaps being less relevant than other classwork.\nStudents liked this course, noting that the complexity of the material made their investigation both challenging and rewarding. A couple reviewers pointed out that it was nice to have a mix of students with backgrounds in East Asian Studies and in Linguistics. A few improvements were suggested for future iterations of EAST1510: firstly, that this class should be offered on a MWF or TTh schedule rather than as a weekly seminar. Additionally, students requested that lecture slides be posted on Canvas and that central linguistics concepts be recapped in the beginning of the semester for people who have not taken Introduction to Linguistics.\n\ninstructor: Instructors\nZhuqing Li\nzhuqing_li@brown.edu\n\nschedule: Schedule and Location\nW 3pm-5:30pm in Sayles Hall 205\n\naverage_hours: 3.00\n\nmax_hours: 5.78\n\ncourse_rating: 49%\n3.72\n\nprofessor_rating: 63%\n3.97\n\nprofessor_and_term: EAST 1510 | Li, Zhuqing (S1) | Fall 2016\n\n", "code: EAST 1931\n\nterm: Spring 2025\n\ntitle: Market Economy, Popular Culture, and Mass Media in Contemporary China\n\ndescription: Course focuses on mainland Chinese cultural and media production since the mid 1980's, when China began transforming itself culturally and economically into a capitalist society with socialist characteristics.

It provides an introduction to economic analysis and prepares students to apply these skills to current social problems. The course serves as a requirement for all economics concentrators and as a prerequisite for many upper-level economics courses. Although ECON0110 is an introductory course with no formal prerequisites, students noted that previous experience in high school courses such as macroeconomics or microeconomics can be helpful. In addition, mathematics and knowledge in calculus could be beneficial but not required.\nProfessor Rachel Friedberg was praised as a passionate lecturer who tied concepts to real-life situations and used personal examples to facilitate learning. Professor Friedberg was praised for her commitment to encouraging student participation, however, some respondents noted that given the sheer size of the class, this was not always possible. Some students noted that neither the annotated slides nor lecture recordings were posted online, which they found contributed to ineffective learning and made reviewing material more difficult. In addition, a majority of respondents noted that examples covered in class do not reflect the level of difficulty covered in homework and exams, and students should not solely rely on lecture content.\nAssignments included weekly readings and homework assignments, but the majority of a student\u2019s grade was attributed to three midterms and one final. Students noted that exams could be quite unforgiving due to the high proportion of multiple-choice questions and stated that it was imperative to take practice exams to familiarize oneself with them. Students also noted that in addition to paying attention in lectures, doing the assigned readings is also important for success since textbook topics that are not covered in class sometimes also show up on the exams.\nOverall, students reported that ECON0110 helped them attain a general and broad understanding of economics. Several students stated that taking this course provided them with \u201ca different perspective\u201d and \u201ca very unique way of thinking\u201d. Students emphasized the importance of keeping on track with the workload and going to lectures, stating that doing so should enable prospective students to handle the workload the course requires.\n\ninstructor: Instructors\nRachel Friedberg\nrachel_friedberg@brown.edu\n\nschedule: Schedule and Location\nMWF 9am-9:50am in Salomon Center DECI\n\naverage_hours: 3.82\n\nmax_hours: 9.25\n\ncourse_rating: 50%\n3.74\n\nprofessor_rating: 67%\n4.21\n\nprofessor_and_term: ECON 0110 | Friedberg, Rachel (S1) | Fall 2023\n\n", "code: ECON 0160\n\nterm: Spring 2025\n\ntitle: Intro to Finance - Money, Markets and You\n\ndescription: References to business, accounting, and financial markets are ubiquitous in our daily lives but are often intimidating to the outsider due to the specialized vocabulary and extensive use of abbreviations and acronyms (S&P 500, Fed Funds rate, EBITDA, EPS, P/E, DCF, EVA, etc.).

This course covers calculus and other topics relevant to upper-level study in economics. As opposed to the standard mathematics progression, ECON0170 places more emphasis on problem-solving and applications and less on proofs. The course\u2019s official prerequisite is one introductory calculus course, such as MATH0060, MATH0070, MATH0090, or AP Calculus AB. Reviewers generally felt that basic calculus knowledge from any of these sources, along with \u201cPrinciples of Economics\u201d (ECON0110), was helpful background for this course.\nProfessor Alex Poterack was overwhelmingly considered a concise and effective lecturer, with different reviewers calling his teaching style \u201cirreproachable,\u201d \u201ctimely,\u201d and \u201cto the point.\u201d This year, all lectures were asynchronous, but students greatly appreciated the easily digestible lengths of the videos and Professor Poterack\u2019s use of worthwhile examples, connections to economic concepts, and worksheets between lecture videos. Some respondents, however, noted that the course\u2019s asynchronous format made it hard to work with other students.\nThe coursework for ECON0170 included six problem sets, three exams, and optional weekly readings. The homework was considered effective in solidifying understanding of course content, and respondents felt that it took a reasonable amount of time to complete as long as one consistently followed the lectures. One reviewer particularly praised the course\u2019s organization and found it easy to keep track of course expectations.\nBased especially on Professor Poterack\u2019s teaching style but inclusive of all elements of the course, reviewers highly recommended ECON0170 as an alternative math-heavy course to MATH0100, though they noted it should generally only be taken by those considering an economics concentration. The only suggestion made by reviewers was to consider including a synchronous component to the course. In addition to shopping \u201cIntroductory Calculus, Part II\u201d (MATH0100), students recommended taking \u201cIntermediate Microeconomics\u201d (ECON1110) alongside or after ECON0170.\n\ninstructor: Instructors\nGyungbae Park\ngyungbae_park@brown.edu\nYidi Wu\nyidi_wu1@brown.edu\n\nschedule: Schedule and Location\nMWF 1pm-1:50pm in Smith-Buonanno Hall 106\n\naverage_hours: 2.82\n\nmax_hours: 4.91\n\ncourse_rating: 86%\n4.35\n\nprofessor_rating: 93%\n4.66\n\nprofessor_and_term: ECON 0170 | Poterack, Alex (S1) | Summer 2021\n\n", "code: ECON 0400\n\nterm: Spring 2025\n\ntitle: Race and Inequality in America\n\ndescription: This seminar examines the social disadvantage of African American in the United States from the perspectives of economics, though with due attention to sociology, politics and history.

Students learn about the accounting procedures for various forms of business organizations. There are no official prerequisites for this course. Reviewers found a basic understanding of math to be beneficial for success in this class.\nThe course was completely asynchronous, taught through lecture recordings without notes or PowerPoint slides. Many students had difficulty with this teaching style, saying that they preferred visual learning aids, and students found many of the topics covered as not helpful for exams. However, reviewers pointed to the extended teaching team as being extremely helpful, with some TAs recording extra instructional videos and holding weekly review sessions to promote student success.\nCourse material consisted of weekly chapter readings and optional homework problem sets. There were two midterm exams as well as a final non-cumulative exam. Reviewers said that the optional homework assignments were very beneficial in preparing for the exam, as the exam content often went well past what was covered in lecture. Classes often went shorter than the listed time, and students found that the weekly outside-of-class investment was very low,\nOverall, students had mixed feelings about ECON0710. Many reviewers thought the lecture style was \u201cineffective\u201d and that the professors could be unorganized and unapproachable at times. That said, some reviewers emphasized the importance of the content for entering the world of accounting, and recommended that prospective students to consider taking an online course on the material instead. Overall, reviewers cautiously recommended this course to those interested in business work and accounting.\n\ninstructor: Instructors\nMark Correia\nmark_correia@brown.edu\n\nschedule: Schedule and Location\nTTh 2:30pm-3:50pm in S.

Prerequisites for this course include ECON0110 or high school transfer credits. Students found that basic economics knowledge and experience in other economics courses served them greatly, but that an extensive economics background was not completely necessary.\nRespondents agreed that Professor Glenn Loury was \u201chighly knowledgeable and committed to open discourse\u201d, praising his passion and the multiple perspectives he brought. Lectures were entertaining and informative, but the long class time sometimes made constant engagement difficult. Some thought that Professor Loury\u2019s use of PowerPoint slides was hard to follow, and that his discussion-based lectures were not suited to a larger class. Respondents largely found Professor Loury to be highly receptive to students\u2019 questions and welcoming during office hours.\nThe course consisted of weekly readings, frequent pop quizzes on the readings, and three short papers involving topics related to the course material. Respondents noted that the precision required for the pop quizzes was sometimes difficult to deal with, and that the readings were fairly long and time-consuming.\nDespite the difficulty of working through the coursework, all respondents found the instructor and course material to be highly interesting and comprehensive in nature. Respondents indicated that doing the readings were essential to the course, as well as taking part in in-class discussions.

The official prerequisite for this course is prior completion of a related course e.g. MATH0060, 0070, 0090, 0100, 0170, 0180, 0190, 0200, 0350, or ECON0170 or a score of a 4 in AP Calculus AB or a 3 in AP Calculus BC. Though certainly helpful, many respondents agreed that this course didn\u2019t necessarily depend on extreme competence in these prerequisites.\n\u201cIntroduction to Game Theory\u201d was taught by Professor Geoffrey De Clippel via the use of recorded, asynchronous lectures. Much of these lectures featured Powerpoint presentations or written problems. The concepts in these lectures were discussed and solidified in weekly TA sessions. Respondents seemed to either appreciate or dislike the format of this class; while the asynchronous teaching style provided many students flexible hours and plenty of choice in how they pursue their work, it also left many feeling distant from the material and lectures.\nThe coursework for ECON1090 consisted of weekly problem sets, discussions, and sections. Assessments also consisted of a midterm, a final, and several ungraded quizzes. Students found the flexibility in these assignments useful, though many commented about the weightiness of the midterm.\nOverall, students generally found \u201cIntroduction to Game Theory\u201d to be an interesting introduction to game theory. Though the material was interesting, respondents did emphasize that potential shoppers should make sure to fully consider their relationship with the format of the course: in other words, students should be prepared for the asynchronous, prerecorded lectures and the TA led sections and consider whether that is the environment they would thrive in.\n\ninstructor: Instructors\nGeoffroy De Clippel\ngeoffroy_declippel@brown.edu\n\nschedule: Schedule and Location\nMWF 10am-10:50am in Friedman Hall 102\n\naverage_hours: 2.80\n\nmax_hours: 4.75\n\ncourse_rating: 59%\n3.96\n\nprofessor_rating: 76%\n4.24\n\nprofessor_and_term: ECON 1090 | De Clippel, Geoffroy (S1) | Summer 2021\n\n", "code: ECON 1110\n\nterm: Fall 2024\n\ntitle: Intermediate Microeconomics\n\ndescription: \u201cIntermediate Microeconomics\u201d (ECON1110) is an economics course that establishes tools for use in microeconomic analysis, with some applicability to public policy.

Course prerequisites are \u201cPrinciples of Economics\u201d (ECON0110) and a calculus credit.\nProfessor Pedro Dal Bo was described as passionate, but respondents found his teaching of new content ineffective. Most students found that a lack of slides was detrimental to effective communication of material. Instead of slides, Professor Dal Bo\u2019s teaching style revolved around graphs drawn on the board, which multiple reviewers noted were confusing and poorly explained. Due to a lack of prepared online material, it was difficult to review lecture notes and catch up on missed concepts. However, students noted that Professor Dal Bo was receptive to student needs and available for feedback outside of class.\nAssignments for this class consisted of homework assignments, quizzes, and exams. Homework assignments and quizzes were each once a week, with quizzes being taken during conferences. Exams consisted of two midterms and a final exam. Problem sets and exams were found to be relatively difficult. Videos were provided that covered the topics for assignments and exams, and while they were a helpful resource, the videos did not cover enough material to help students do well on assignments or exams.\nWith all respondents noting only introductory economics as a useful background, this class is useful and accessible for both concentrators and non-concentrators interested in learning how to apply economic theory to real-world problems and analysis.

Prerequisites include ECON0110 and a math background up to at least MATH0100 or ECON 0170; many respondents suggested prospective students also have a solid background in multivariable calculus and partial derivatives.\nProfessor Rajiv Vohra was described as having a traditional yet fast-paced lecture style, with well-prepared lectures that heavily encouraged questions and class participation. While some found this style to be helpful, the primary complaint was that Professor Vohra\u2019s in-class examples were often \u201con-the-fly\u201d and difficult to answer. Students found lectures engaging yet easy to misunderstand. Despite this, Professor Vohra\u2019s passion for the topic was apparent through his knowledge and genuine interest in students.\nThe coursework included nine problem sets, five short in-class quizzes, two midterm exams, and one final exam. Respondents emphasized that attending lectures and reading the textbook were often their main source of understanding. Lecture notes also proved to be a point of clarification when reviewing for exams.\nIn general, reviewers had mixed feelings about ECON1130 and the effectiveness of lectures. Ultimately, reviewers felt that the delivery of material could be improved, as well as accessibility to real-life practice scenarios.

One can take this class, put the time into problem sets and studying and get an A. But don't take this class for that. Take the class for Chay and his commentary.\" Students were unanimous in praising Professor Chay's enthusiasm for the subject. Additionally, students felt that the Professor's availability outside of class was not a concern.\nStudents felt that \"Labor Economics\" was moderately time-intensive. The class had five problem sets which required problem-solving and considerable effort. The class also had three to five readings per week in the form of textbook chapters or articles.

Students felt this course had serious real world applications. Respondents cited the required prerequisite of Intermediate Microeconomics (ECON 1110/1130) along with Principles of Economics as beneficial background for this course.\nAll respondents described Professor Alex Poterack as an excellent lecturer. His lectures were always clear, and his passion made them very engaging. Poterack wrote notes in real-time, which helped students keep pace, and students felt that sometimes his lectures felt like he was telling a story. Poterack was even described by a student as \u201cone of the best lecturers I\u2019ve encountered at Brown!\u201d\n\u201cEnvironmental Economics and Policy\u201d coursework included five problem sets, two in-person midterm exams, and an in-person final exam. Students noted that the midterms tended to differ from the problem sets, and the course content was balanced between economics and mathematics material. Respondents generally spent three hours per week on this course and around eight hours on the busiest weeks. This course was described as very interesting, applicable to the real world, and overall easygoing.\nOverall, students thought this course was very useful, and Professor Poterack\u2019s lectures were highly praised.

Official prerequisites for the class include ECON1110 and ECON1620 or equivalents. Students also mentioned that prior experience in academic writing was useful, given that some assignments were very writing-heavy.\nProfessor David Weil incorporated a mix of lecture and discussion throughout the course. Many students stressed the importance of the discussion component of the course, observing that a lot of time was dedicated to these \"meaningful\" discussions. Further, students remarked that Professor Weil led the discussion in productive ways and explained concepts clearly. Although the discussions helped lend an \u201capproachable\u201d atmosphere to the class, one student felt that the course could benefit from more encouragement to attend office hours.\nThe course involved a variety of assignments, including weekly readings, five problem sets, two midterm exams, and a final exam. One student noted that the exams could be challenging because they included theoretical models from class and referenced parts of the readings. More generally, students agreed that the course touched on a wide variety of subjects within economics, including \u201clabor, health, industrial organization, and public.\u201d In fact, one student thought that the course discussed \u201cpretty much every subject\u201d within economics. Overall, students described the material as interesting and praised the course\u2019s consistency in presenting new topics to students.\nThere were notably favorable responses among some students when reflecting on the course as a whole. One student described the course as \u201cone of the best economics courses at Brown\u201d and another as their \u201cfavorite class at Brown.\u201d Both emphasized the variety of subjects that the course introduces and the interesting material that those subjects provide.

Students explored the growth and decline of urban infrastructure throughout history and the policies that contributed to these changes. The official prerequisites for the course are ECON 1110 or 1130, or ECON 1620 or 1630 and APMA 1650. Students felt that the economics and statistics prerequisites were appropriate as the knowledge that they gained in these classes made them well prepared for the coursework.\nProfessor Nathaniel Baum-Snow was lauded for his effective lectures and his ability to encourage class participation. He was described by respondents as very caring towards his students in wanting them to succeed; students appreciated the discussions he held during lectures about urban policies. Some students felt that Professor Baum-Snow's lecture material was dry, and at times even boring. He was very available outside of class via email and office hours and students felt that he gave useful feedback. However, many class members considered the TAs much more helpful when seeking feedback on problem sets.\nCoursework consisted of weekly reading, five problem sets, one midterm exam and a final exam. Assigned readings, including economic papers, were essential for exams. Most students, however, commented that they were too long and too many. They also suggested that while the readings were useful, having more practice questions similar to those on the exams would have helped immensely.\nOverall students highly recommended this course to those who are up for a challenge and have a genuine interest in the subject matter. They had several ideas to improve the course, such as including a textbook and focusing more on empirical data rather than models. Nevertheless, this is definitely a great course to take for economics concentrators with an interest in cities and the urbanization process.\n\ninstructor: Instructors\nMatthew Turner\nmatthew_turner@brown.edu\n\nschedule: Schedule and Location\nMW 8:30am-9:50am Location TBD\n\naverage_hours: 3.33\n\nmax_hours: 6.73\n\ncourse_rating: 60%\n4.48\n\nprofessor_rating: 63%\n4.68\n\nprofessor_and_term: ECON 1410 | Baum-Snow, Nathaniel (S1) | Fall 2013\n\n", "code: ECON 1420\n\nterm: Fall 2024\n\ntitle: Industrial Organization\n\ndescription: \u201cIndustrial Organization\u201d (ECON1420) is a course that aims to study industry structure and firm behavior and its implications in settings where the assumptions of perfect competition do not occur. The course utilizes theoretical and empirical examinations of strategic firm interactions in oligopolistic markets, dominant firm behaviors, entry deterrence by incumbents, and marketplace design. The official prerequisite for this course is \u201cIntermediate Microeconomics\u201d (ECON1110 or ECON1130), and reviewers remarked that this course was highly relevant due to its somewhat mathematical nature.\nProfessor Manuel Lancastre was praised as a passionate and attentive lecturer. Respondents appreciated how Professor Lancastre used past experiences and real-world situations to clarify and connect the concepts taught. Students noted that his personal experiences and encouragement of class participation enhanced lecture effectiveness, although the mathematical and proof-heavy parts of the course were universally considered harder to digest.\nCourse assignments consisted of eight homework sets, class and section participation, two midterms, and a final exam. Notably, participation was optional and could only contribute positively to a student\u2019s final grade. The mathematical part of the course was stressed in the problem sets, but respondents described it as doable.\nOverall, ECON1420 was described as a well-taught course where students learned a lot. Respondents especially praised Professor Lancastre\u2019s effective lecturing through the use of personal experiences. Class members did note that the course is not for all, as it focuses more on topics relevant to business and microeconomics rather than public economic policy. However, for prospective students interested in firm behavior in a more real-world scenario (i.e., without perfect competition) or those who just enjoyed ECON1130, this is a great course to take.\n\ninstructor: Instructors\nIvan Kwok\nivan_kwok@brown.edu\n\nschedule: Schedule and Location\nTTh 9am-10:20am in S.

Reviewers highly recommended EC111, which is also a prerequisite. Also highly recommended was EC162 Econometrics. Students found EC121 and a strong background in statistics useful but not necessary.\nReviewers had various compliments and criticisms of Professor Qian. Some praised her relevant examples and questions to the class which they said promoted the discussion which was a large part of class, while others wished there had been more discussion. Some other praise targeted her handouts and willingness to answer questions, while criticism dealt with her speeding through difficult concepts and her mechanical delivery.\nMost students found some of the readings useful, though opinion differed on how many of them were good. Some did not enjoy the more technical aspects of them. Besides the readings, the classwork was five problem sets, a presentation, a short paper, a midterm, and a final exam. A few class members thought the problem sets were too time-consuming, or that the midterm was too long.\nAccording to survey respondents, the course took between two and five hours of their time outside of class. The most common recommendations to those thinking about taking the class was to always do the readings, as one won't get much out of class without doing them. Students also called it a very challenging class with great information.\n\ninstructor: Instructors\nEmily Oster\nemily_oster@brown.edu\n\nschedule: Schedule and Location\nTTh 10:30am-11:50am Location TBD\n\nprograms: Curricular Programs\nWriting - Designated Courses (WRIT)\n\naverage_hours: N/A\n\nmax_hours: N/A\n\ncourse_rating: 58%\n4.36\n\nprofessor_rating: 73%\n4.09\n\nprofessor_and_term: ECON 1430 | Qian, Nancy (S1) | Spring 2007\n\n", "code: ECON 1450\n\nterm: Fall 2024\n\ntitle: Economic Organizations and Economic Systems\n\ndescription: *Please note that this course was taught online \u2013 this review may not be reflective of future semesters*\n\u201cEconomic Organizations and Economic Systems\u201d (ECON1450) is an advanced economics course for students interested in the institutional structures and organizations which characterize a modern mixed market economy. Official prerequisites for the class are ECON0110 and ECON1110. The course caters to upper-level economics concentrators and students interested in applying economic theory to public policy, political science, and international relations.\nSurvey respondents described Professor Louis Putterman as an effective instructor. He was clearly passionate about the material and painted a clear, big-picture summary of the topics of the lecture for his students. The asynchronous, pre-recorded lectures, along with the class session materials, felt repetitive at times, but this ensured that students who could not attend class did not fall behind. Because of his noted dedication to students, Putterman was described by one student as the \u201cmost accessible economics professor [they] had ever had.\u201d Some students did, however suggest that the professor integrate more opportunities for discussion and student-to-student knowledge exchange.\nThere were seven homework assignments, four non-cumulative quizzes, and a final paper (~20 pages). Additionally, class members who were able to participate synchronously were asked to play the role of \u201cexpert\u201d during one unit of the class. Respondents agreed that the course requirements were challenging but definitely manageable. Students spent an average of four hours a week working outside of class and a maximum of nine hours.\nOverall, respondents suggested that ECON1450 is a great economics course. If prospective students are looking to learn more about and examine the intersection between economics and policy, this class comes recommended.

Students found Professor Nathaniel Hilger to be very approachable and available outside of class. Some respondents noted that his lectures were strictly based off of PowerPoints, and wished he had gone into more detail with some of the models.\nThe assignments for \u201cPublic Economics\u201d consisted of biweekly problem sets, a midterm, and a final exam. Several students responded that they felt the problem sets were difficult and too long. Others thought the assignments were good practice and that the material was helpful in everyday life. Overall, the assignments were said to be ultimately relevant to course material. Students typically spent between four and ten hours per week on this course.\nAs suggestions for improvement, students stated that they would have preferred to cover less material and to move a bit slower through the topics. Some noted that they would have appreciated more help with STATA, the software program used in the course.

Prerequisites include ECON1110 and ECON1620 (or an equivalent mathematics course), both of which were deemed essential by respondents. Several respondents also found an upper-level econometrics course like ECON1629 helpful.\nProfessor Andrew Foster taught mostly through lectures and the use of the board to break down mathematical models. He was praised for his passion for the material and the way he made the material accessible to students. Many reviewers also stated that the two and a half hour lectures went by much faster than one would expect, with the instructor not spending too much time on any given topic. However, one respondent wished that Professor Foster had posted his notes to Canvas, because the lectures were at times difficult to keep up with. Another warned that the grading was exceptionally slow, taking over a month for each assignment.\nCourse requirements included reading weekly academic articles, weekly responses and quizzes, three problem sets, three short papers (three to five-pages in length), and one take-home final exam. Students noted that, given the sheer volume of assignments, it was essential to keep up with the material throughout the course. Some also warned that the weekly readings could be long and confusing, with mathematical models often fundamental to the content; having prior experience with economics literature was thus recommended for those considering taking the course.\nThough demanding strong reading abilities and sharp mathematical intuition, \u201cHealth, Hunger and the Household in Developing Countries\u201d proved a worthwhile experience for many.

The official prerequisites include an introductory economics course (ECON0110, ECON1100, or ECON 1130) and an introductory calculus or equivalent course (MATH0090/ECON0170). Students noted basic statistics knowledge (APMA1650) was helpful but not required for success.\nStudents praised Professor Brian Knight for his clear and concise lectures. Presentations incorporated all relevant material, and students appreciated that slides were posted following each lecture. Students considered Professor Knight\u2019s practice problems extremely effective. In fact, Professor Knight discussed in the course syllabus that \u201cat least one exam question from each midterm and final exam will be based upon these problem-solving sessions.\u201d However, many wished more practice problems were solved on the board for a more engaging lecture.\nCoursework for ECON1620 consisted of weekly homework assignments, Stata exercises, two midterm exams, and a final exam. Despite the heavy weight of exams, respondents found that assignments reflected exam material. Alongside office hour attendance and keeping up with course readings, students noted that completing the practice problems provided by the instructor was an invaluable method of exam preparation.\nOverall, students considered ECON1620 a great econometrics course for concentrators and non-concentrators interested in the intersection of mathematics and economics. Respondents observed that if one puts in all the work asked, they will surely perform well. As a potential alternative to this course, students recommended CLPS0900, which uses the statistical software R instead of Stata and explores similar content.\n\ninstructor: Instructors\nBrian Knight\nbrian_knight@brown.edu\n\nschedule: Schedule and Location\nTTh 9am-10:20am in Friedman Hall 208\n\naverage_hours: 4.09\n\nmax_hours: 7.82\n\ncourse_rating: 62%\n3.83\n\nprofessor_rating: 74%\n4.17\n\nprofessor_and_term: ECON 1620 | Knight, Brian (S1) | Fall 2022\n\n", "code: ECON 1629\n\nterm: Fall 2024\n\ntitle: Applied Research Methods for Economists\n\ndescription: We can formulate and ask new questions about causality all day long. For instance, will an increase in marketing expenses lead to higher revenue for Apple? Will extending hours of the Rock increase the number of students who prefer the Rock? Such questions seem difficult to answer. After all, there have to be countless factors that determine an individual\u2019s decision. Economists, however, have a solution. In \u201cApplied Research Methods for Economists\u201d (ECON1629), students harness the power of applied economic research to test economic hypotheses. Prerequisites for the class are \"Intermediate Microeconomics\" (ECON1110) and \"Introduction to Econometrics\" (ECON1620). Students especially emphasized the importance of the econometrics prerequisite.\nProfessor Lorenzo Lagos\u2019s instruction elicited a wide array of responses from the students. One student praised Professor Lagos as a \u201cgreat lecturer\u201d and remarked that the course was perhaps one of the most organized that the student had taken. Another student, however, commented that Professor Lagos\u2019s lectures suffered from an inconsistency between the slides and the handouts, which made the lecture \u201chard to follow.\u201d Nonetheless, there was a general consensus that Professor Lagos was well-prepared with regard to the lecture material.\nThe course involved a variety of assignments, which included weekly readings and discussion posts, problem sets, two midterm exams, a final exercise, and a final project. Students were also evaluated on class participation. The final exercise involved writing a recommendation memo based on a series of evidence from several studies. One student praised the problem sets as helpful in understanding the class material. Another respondent remarked that the Stata section of the homework sometimes proved difficult and required seeking help through office hours.\nGenerally, students agreed that the course offered interesting material. One student, however, wished to inform prospective students that the latter part of the course, which involves practical applications, may be of more interest than the former, which primarily deals with foundational material. On the other hand, one student remarked that they would take the course even if it were not a requirement, attributing its relevance to practical applications. So whether you're knocking out a concentration requirement or just interested in the material, this may be a meaningful course for you!\n\ninstructor: Instructors\nAnna Aizer\nanna_aizer@brown.edu\n\nschedule: Schedule and Location\nTTh 10:30am-11:50am in List Art Center 110\n\naverage_hours: 4.17\n\nmax_hours: 8.20\n\ncourse_rating: 48%\n3.60\n\nprofessor_rating: 67%\n4.14\n\nprofessor_and_term: ECON 1629 | Lagos, Lorenzo (S1) | Fall 2023\n\n", "code: ECON 1630\n\nterm: Fall 2024\n\ntitle: Mathematical Econometrics I\n\ndescription: \"Mathematical Econometrics I\" (ECON1630) is an advanced introduction to econometrics course that aims to teach students how to formulate and test economic questions of interest with applications in finance and economics. In particular, the course focuses on the multivariate linear regression model and also tests the model's underlying assumptions. The official prerequisites for this course are \"Intermediate Microeconomics\" (ECON1110 or ECON1130), \"Linear Algebra\" (MATH 0520 or 0540), and a course in Statistical Inference (APMA 1650, CSCI 1450, 0450, MATH 1620, ECON 1620 or APMA 1655), which reviewers remarked as essential due to the mathematical nature of the course.\nProfessor Jonathan Roth was praised as a caring and passionate professor. Students noted that his lecture slides and use of examples were highly effective, contributing to well-used class time and heightened engagement in the class. Still, some students considered his pace to be too fast, a problem that various students alleviated by attending TA sessions or Professor Roth's hours.\nCourse assignments consisted of six problem sets, one midterm, and a final exam, with the lowest problem set grade being dropped. Class members described the problem sets as an application and integration of the theory learned in class on real data sets, further emphasizing the mathematical nature of the course.\nOverall, ECON1630 was described as a well-taught course in which students learned a lot. Although the course is heavy on math and statistics, respondents universally noted that the various resources available, combined with Professor Roth's willingness to help, set students up for success and made receiving a good grade manageable.\n\ninstructor: Instructors\nAndriy Norets\nandriy_norets@brown.edu\n\nschedule: Schedule and Location\nTTh 2:30pm-3:50pm in 85 Waterman Street 015\n\naverage_hours: 5.00\n\nmax_hours: 10.20\n\ncourse_rating: 57%\n3.55\n\nprofessor_rating: 71%\n3.93\n\nprofessor_and_term: ECON 1630 | Roth, Jonathan (S1) | Fall 2023\n\n", "code: ECON 1670\n\nterm: Spring 2025\n\ntitle: Advanced Topics in Econometrics\n\ndescription: This class will present advanced topics in Econometrics.

Prerequisites are ECON1110 and ECON1620 or equivalents.\nProfessor Sylvia Kuo was praised for the passion and energy that she brought to the class. One student praised Professor Kuo\u2019s feedback and improvement-focused approach. Specifically, they explained that homework was graded on completion, not correctness, and always provided tips on how to improve. However, students thought that Professor Kuo\u2019s lectures could move quickly. One student attributed this fast pace to the fact that Professor Kuo used the blackboard instead of slides, which may have resulted in difficulty keeping up with notes.\nCourse assignments consisted of weekly homework assignments, two midterms, and a final exam. The homework assignments were graded based on completion. Further, there were weekly sections with the TA where students went over the homework together. Regarding the exams, some students felt that they focused more on memorization of vocabulary or formulas. Nonetheless, one student remarked that they were a \u201cdecent test of knowledge.\u201d\nOverall, if you're looking to learn more about investing, this may be the course for you. A student remarked that the course was a \u201cdecent\u201d choice for those seeking to acquire general knowledge about the stock market and various investing strategies. However, students wished to inform prospective students that the course can feel as though it emphasizes memorization of concepts.

While \"Investments I\" (ECON1710) is the official prerequisite, students have noted that courses like \"Financial Accounting\" (ECON0710) and a background in finance also helped them to understand the course material better.\nProfessor Bradford Gibbs was praised for his dynamic and engaging teaching. His presentations were clear, and students appreciated that he was always ready to answer questions, making learning more interactive and personal.\nThe class assignments consisted of seven weekly problem sets, two quizzes, one in-class exam, and two team projects. Professor Gibbs used TopHat to track attendance and blended in Excel skills and case studies to make the course more interactive and practical. Students observed that the course becomes more challenging as it progresses, and they emphasized the need to stay on track with textbook readings and case studies to do well. The team projects were described as challenging and requiring significant effort.\nIn summary, reviewers felt ECON1720 was generally a challenging but highly beneficial course. It provides essential knowledge for anyone looking to enter the finance field. Despite the difficulties posed by projects that mimic real-life scenarios, students felt these experiences were invaluable for building important skills through practical application.\n\ninstructor: Instructors\nBradford Gibbs\nbradford_gibbs@brown.edu\n\nschedule: Schedule and Location\nMWF 10am-10:50am in Bio Med Center 202\n\naverage_hours: 4.50\n\nmax_hours: 14.50\n\ncourse_rating: 59%\n4.41\n\nprofessor_rating: 77%\n4.79\n\nprofessor_and_term: ECON 1720 | Gibbs, Bradford (S1) | Fall 2023\n\n", "code: ECON 1730\n\nterm: Fall 2024\n\ntitle: Venture Capital, Private Equity, and Entrepreneurship\n\ndescription: \"Venture Capital, Private Equity, and Entrepreneurship\" (ECON1730) gives students the opportunity to experience a class similar to those found in business school. Praised as one of the most unique courses at Brown, ECON1730 pairs students with startups in order to think and make decisions as entrepreneurs and venture capitalists. Official prerequisites for the course include \"Investments I\" (ECON1710) and \"Corporate Finance\" (ECON1720). However, students found summer internships in banking and consulting to be most helpful in preparing them for the course.\nProfessor Raphael La Porta was often labeled as the most noteworthy aspect of the course. Reviewers described Professor La Porta as engaging, funny, and knowledgable of the subject matter. Students also noted Professor La Porta enjoyed \"being hands on,\" often playing devil's advocate to encourage discussion. Professor La Porta's teaching style was described as \"free\", and the class often lacked structures. Some respondents found this sense of freedom liberating while others would have preferred a more organized presentation of theories. Reviewers mentioned that Professor La Porta was always available to meet outside of class and quick to respond to emails.\nClasswork consisted of weekly problem sets and case studies, a final presentation on the startup, and a take-home final exam. Students felt as though the problem sets were often long and difficult. Furthermore, they noted that assignment material was covered after the assignment due date, thus respondents believed a willingness to research material was necessary to complete assignments. Some class members also felt as though the canvas page could be revised and grading policies could be made more explicit.\nMost students spent five to six hours a week outside of class on coursework. In busier weeks, respondents spent 12 hours working on course material. Many reviewers were unable to recommend similar classes to shop given the uniqueness of the course. A few students recommended shopping \"The Entrepreneurial Process: Innovation in Practice\" (ENGN1010).

Despite the course\u2019s many prerequisites, Professor Rozen does not assume too much prior knowledge, ensuring that all material is covered. If a student was lost, she took time to explain the material fully and was responsive to student connections. Although some respondents felt she went too in depth on technical aspects of the course, most students found the material taught to be interesting. In particular, students enjoyed her engaging whiteboard lectures, a departure from her normal PowerPoint format. She was described as very available, although some students requested more frequent office hours.\nCoursework included two midterms, one final, and eight bi-weekly problem sets. Respondents wrote that the problem sets were reasonably difficult, very helpful for learning the material, and more in depth than in class examples. Exams were described as similar to the homework.\nStudents remember this class as a solid background for real world finance.

Professor Steffes was found to be very available and helpful during office hours and good at providing constructive feedback on essays. However, there were no rubrics for grading which made it hard while writing papers.\nSince the course satisfies the WRIT requirement, this class is considered writing-intensive. Each week, students are expected to complete a section of readings and reflect in their journals to prepare for discussion. Other assignments include presentations, essays, and a semester-long project. Some respondents found the readings redundant but helpful in solidifying information.\nOverall, students enjoyed the in-class debates and lively discussions. The biggest suggestion to improve the course was to assign less repetitive readings and include clearer assignment guidelines. Other similar courses in the history and education department include \u201cThe Campus on Fire: American Colleges and Universities in the 1960\u2019s\u201d (EDUC0400), \u201cAmerican Higher Education in Historical Context\u201d (EDUC1730), and \u201cAdolescence in Social Context\u201d (EDUC1270). However, many students noted that this course is unique as there is a clear focus on the Brown v.

Several respondents praised Professor Thomas\u2019 ability to spark meaningful conversations, particularly through her thorough discussion questions and how she embraced the diversity of students' educational experiences represented within the class. Students also appreciated Professor Thomas\u2019 approachable and understanding demeanor, giving thoughtful responses to student questions and concerns even in an online course as an example. A few students mentioned that they wished Professor Thomas had more clearly communicated assignment prompts and due dates.\nCoursework consisted of readings, required attendance and participation in class discussions, one short writing assignment, and a final policy proposal project. Many respondents mentioned class discussions, where they shared perspectives surrounding the history and future of the public school system, as among their favorite parts of the class, saying that Professor Thomas was great at prompting thought-provoking conversations, although a few also noted the occasional awkwardness and stiltedness of the breakout room format. Several respondents also enjoyed Professor Thomas\u2019 utilization of short videos to accompany her lectures, which one respondent said \u201chelped highlight nationwide conversations, personal anecdotes, and made lectures more engaging\u201d.\nAll in all, students recommended EDUC0820 as a relatively low-stress class dedicated to exploring important topics such as the experience of undocumented students in the United States or LGBTQ+ equity policies in schools. Although many respondents were education concentrators or had taken a number of education courses prior to EDUC0820, they felt that the course was valuable to both future educators and to those who simply want to better understand the United States educational system.\n\ninstructor: Instructors\nJacques Lesure\njacques_lesure@brown.edu\n\nschedule: Schedule and Location\nMWF 12pm-12:50pm in Friedman Hall 208\n\naverage_hours: 1.64\n\nmax_hours: 6.64\n\ncourse_rating: 59%\n3.99\n\nprofessor_rating: 77%\n4.56\n\nprofessor_and_term: EDUC 0820 | Thomas, Crystal (S1) | Fall 2021\n\n", "code: EDUC 0870\n\nterm: Spring 2025\n\ntitle: Perspectives on Multilingual Learners in US Schools\n\ndescription: Students in Rhode Island\u2019s public schools report speaking over 100 different languages and, in our urban core public schools, nearly 30% of students are designated as Multilingual Learners (MLLs).

The general consensus was that the readings were not necessary for writing the papers.\nWhile some class members report putting in consistently a large amount of effort, others became discouraged during the semester. Those that were motivated cited the readings, discussions, and professor as the motivating factors. These students felt they learned a lot about racism and multicultural issues. They also felt that the other students made the class very enjoyable. Ironically, the same factors, readings, discussions, and the professor, were the reasons why others became demotivated during the semester.

The course is primarily geared toward concentrators in geology, with all respondents agreeing that it is not a course for casual shoppers. Reviewers also recommended taking the course as a Junior or Senior, and not concurrently with too many other difficult courses. The course requires its students to have taken either \"Physical Processes in Geology\" (GEOL0220) or \"Earth: Evolution of a Habitable Planet\"(GEOL0240), but also recommends \"Fossil Record\" (GEOL0310) and \"Mineralogy\" (GEOL1410). Students also added \"Structural Geology\" (GEOL1450) and \"Physical Processes in Geology\" (GEOL0230) to that list. In short, as one reviewer put it, prospective students are advised to have taken \"as much geo as possible.\"\nProfessor James Russell received many compliments on his teaching from respondents. Reviewers praised him for being enthusiastic and organized, as well as for encouraging participation and posing tough, but fascinating questions to the class. One student particularly praised his involvement with the students, saying that he \"loves to help and guide you in the right direction.\" With such a comment, it's also no surprise that he was always available outside of class to help students. The course also had a staff of one graduate TA and two UTAs. The graduate TA, Vivian Sun, received good reviews as well. She was described as an effective communicator with an excellent framework of knowledge to share.\nMany reviewers described the workload for the class as difficult. The course assigned two critical reviews of four to six pages each, four labs, two significant stratigraphy projects, a midterm, and a final. Reviewers felt that the stratigraphy projects were especially time consuming and difficult to complete with the required analysis. Students had numerous suggestions for improving the manageability of the course load, such as splitting the projects up into smaller chunks and giving them clearer goals. There were also three field trips throughout the semester, which the respondents all praised for the interactivity and the class bonding time they offered. Overall, students thinking of taking this course should be prepared for a busy semester.\nUltimately, this is a difficult, yet rewarding course. Reviewers noted that this course is a rite of passage for geology concentrators, and should be treated as such. Reviewers believed that Professor Russell was an excellent professor, and the material he covered was challenging, but also fascinating and relevant in its applications. When it came to improving the course, the Stratigraphy projects were without a doubt the hottest topic. Reviewers felt that they were overly time consuming, and could have been made easier through more checkpoints and manageable goals.

Students must have taken GEOL0250, GEOL0350, PHYS0720, or APMA0340 before taking this course. Several respondents also noted that having some background in physics or thermodynamics, as well as some programming knowledge, was helpful.\nProfessor Jung-Eun Lee received largely positive reviews from students, who described her as a very passionate lecturer. Students appreciated how Professor Lee spent time reviewing important concepts at the beginning of each class, many and noted that she always welcomed questions and encouraged interdisciplinary applications. Some students found that her heavy reliance on graphs and data in lecture slides sometimes made it a bit difficult to extract big-picture concepts. Respondents agreed that Professor Lee was very available outside of class and always willing to help students and clarify course material.\nAssignments for the course consisted of bi-weekly problem sets in Python, one midterm exam, and one final exam. Students found the assignments to be difficult but agreed that they were helpful in solidifying class concepts and refining students\u2019 programming skills. Students reported spending an average of five hours per week on class assignments.\nStudents overall enjoyed this class and appreciated the ability to develop familiarity with climate modeling and programming throughout the course.

Along with class prerequisites, students suggested taking \u201cEarth: Evolution of a Habitable Planet\u201d (GEOL0240), other geology courses covering oceans, and introductory computer science classes.\nReviewers praised Professor Baylor Fox-Kemper for his passion and knowledge on course topics. Despite the dense and math-heavy lectures, Professor Fox-Kemper made sure everyone started off on the same base knowledge. Some respondents found the equation derivations hard to follow on the slides versus if they were done on the blackboard. Professor Fox-Kemper made himself very available in office hours and over email and gave clear feedback on assignments.\nRequirements for GEOL1520 include four problem sets, four papers, four paper plans, and four peer reviews, all set in four distinct cycles. Reviewers found the work difficult and time-consuming but very worth while. Students valued the assignments as they solidified core concepts and improved reading, writing, and reviewing skills.\nRespondents loved this course for its investigation into important questions, especially about climate change. Professor Fox-Kemper was passionate, funny, and approachable, and additionally provided great feedback. However, students would have preferred a course website, deeper explanations of the data sets, and three cycles of assignments instead of four.

In addition, several respondents noted that a basic understanding of fundamental chemistry was important for success in the course.\nStudents gave Professor Pieters mixed reviews. While reviewers said that she encouraged students to ask questions and always made herself available for additional help, several class members took issue with her lecture style. Most importantly, students felt that there was too much time spent on physical concepts during class that students could have reviewed on their own time, and they wished that Professor Pieters had spent more time on new geological material.\nAlmost every reviewer praised the assigned readings as being very useful for enhancing class material. Several respondents noted that they found the Crystal Field Theory readings to be particularly engaging. Throughout the course of the semester, students had to complete six labs, two of which were performed in class, one midterm, a final project, and an oral final exam. Class members almost universally agreed that the labs were too long and suggested that the instructors create a separate lab section for future classes.\nMost respondents agreed that the work for this class exceeded their initial expectations, requiring anywhere between five and thirty hours a week to complete everything that was assigned.

In the process we will touch upon some of the major intellectual and social developments of the period, such as Darwin\u2019s theory of evolution, Freud\u2019s theory of the unconscious, the rise of the mass media, the triumph of consumerism, mass immigration, and the system of Jim Crow segregation.\n\ninstructor: Instructors\nStuart Burrows\nstuart_burrows@brown.edu\n\nschedule: Schedule and Location\nMWF 10am-10:50am in List Art Center 110\n\ncritical_review_url: http://www.thecriticalreview.org/ENGL/0101F\n\n", "code: ENGL 0150S\n\nterm: Spring 2025\n\ntitle: The Roaring Twenties\n\ndescription: This course examines U.S. culture of the 1920s, with particular attention to phenomena that came to be mythologized as the \u201croaring twenties\u201d\u2014flappers, movie culture, literary and cultural innovation, primitivism and exoticism.

Why? And more importantly-- how? What is being created when Dev Patel's Gawain wanders through the fog in an oversized scarf, or when Aubrey Plaza's Sister Fernanda waves around a hand axe while screaming at the top of her lungs? In this course, we will read selected highlights from 1000 years of literary history from the European Middle Ages, watch films based (with varying degrees of looseness) on those texts, and explore what it means to adapt something. Along the way, we will learn how to read literature, how to watch movies, and how to think about adaptations beyond the limiting notion of \"faithfulness.\" No previous knowledge of the Middle Ages necessary.

This class reads these works in the context of a number of other texts set at sea, the place of \u2018tall tales,\u2019 of adventure, sometimes of terror, but also of industrial labor, modern commerce, and racial conflict.

Such is the standard work week the world over, but what exactly is the \u201cwork\u201d we do during these hours? What work happens beyond these hours? What does and does not count as work and why? How is work differently configured along lines of race, gender, sexuality, class, and dis/ability? We will address these questions and trouble imaginaries of \u201cfree\u201d labor through attention to enslaved and indentured labor, reproductive and sex work, and migrant and gig work in a global economy. From Herman Melville\u2019s satire, \u201cBartleby, the Scrivener,\u201d to Karl Marx\u2019s and Adam Smith\u2019s theories of labor, to workplace films like Jeanne Dielman and Office Space, this course explores representations of work in its diverse and ubiquitous forms, spanning the age of colonialism to our contemporary global division of labor.\n\ninstructor: Instructors\nRebecca Liu\nrebecca_liu2@brown.edu\n\nschedule: Schedule and Location\nT 4pm-6:30pm in Smith-Buonanno Hall 101\n\nprograms: Curricular Programs\nFirst Year Seminar (FYS)\n\ncritical_review_url: http://www.thecriticalreview.org/ENGL/0151K\n\n", "code: ENGL 0202B\n\nterm: Fall 2024\n\ntitle: What Monks Want: Asceticism and Austerity Across the Global Anglophone\n\ndescription: Today, the word \u201causterity\u201d is strongly associated with harsh economic policies that force people to live with less. But what if a person voluntarily embraces an austere lifestyle? In this course, we will consider the figure of the ascetic\u2014an individual who leads a life of severe self-discipline and restraint\u2014across an expansive range of literature from the Global Anglophone, such as Frankenstein, In the Castle of My Skin, Nervous Conditions, The Inheritance of Loss, and Normal People.

Instead of reading memoirs and realist novels, we will consider how these artists explore forms like short stories, performance, graphic novels, and films, as well as genres like science fiction, horror, mystery, and romance. This course\u2019s focus on speculative and unsettling forms of storytelling will expand our understanding of Asian and Asian diaspora artistry and recast themes of immigration, alienation, belonging, grief, memory, and identity. \u201cWhat if?\u201d is an important question these storytellers ask; \u201cWhat if\" is a type of creativity we will investigate by close reading these recent experiments at the limits of storytelling.

We will consider how writers address problems of reconciliation, reparation, and equality in a colonial and capitalist society, and how they prepare new revolutionary idioms for our time. Primary texts include a balance of prose and poetry (Jamaica Kincaid, J. M. Coetzee, NoViolet Bulawayo, Derek Walcott, Layli Long Soldier, Dionne Brand, Theresa Hak Kyung Cha), plus a graphic novel (Thi Bui) and a film (Saint Omer, dir.

How humans engage with and conceive of the past has been the focus of philosophical and literary study for thousands of years. Whether conceptualized as a form of identity formation, a source of motivation, or an opportunity for reconciliation, memory is deeply integrated into how we think. Throughout this course, we will discuss the influences of memory on individual and collective levels by studying an assortment of poetry, novels, drama, and film. Readings will include texts by William Shakespeare, Virginia Woolf, Toni Morrison, Ilya Kaminsky, and Emily St. John Mandel.

How do medieval texts depict gender categories, relations of desire and violence, intersectional subject positions, and anxieties about sex that remain alive today? What are some currents of fluidity, peculiarity, and rebellion in early ideas about gender and sexuality?

What's so special about literature before that date? The word \u201cliterature\u201d in its modern sense doesn\u2019t even emerge until the 18th century (at the earliest). So is what we\u2019re reading when we read pre-1700 material even literature? We'll survey some writing produced--wait for it--before 1700, consider why we're doing so and whether such a requirement makes sense, and read some material about the function and value of the study of literature in English in the first place.

The course will be about the multiple lives and afterlives of Romanticism, studying a brief period of powerful revolutionary disruptions. Our task will be to explore this critical trans-historical and trans-temporal dialogue and ask: What are the social, political, ethical, and aesthetic questions occasioned by these juxtapositions? How do we assess what romanticism means? How and why does it persist\u2014and perhaps disappear\u2014in the art of our own time?

Given its intent as an introductory course, no prior experience is necessary. Respondents compared the course to an advanced high school English course, with one student saying that it is not very different from AP Language or AP Literature. ENGL0900 is a mandatory S/NC class that is capped at 17 students per section.\nOverall, students highly praised Professor Robert Ward for being personable and dedicated. One student exclaimed, \u201cProfessor Ward deeply cares about his students,\u201d with another echoing, \u201cHe was so kind and gentle.\u201d A respondent described Professor Ward\u2019s teaching as a \u201chands-off approach\u201d in which students would lead conferences and learn on their own, with the professor providing helpful suggestions and feedback. Describing Professor Ward\u2019s tireless devotion to students, one class member said: \u201cFor every essay, he would have you submit a draft and then give his own feedback in writing and in a conference with each student. He will cancel class, have asynchronous work due, and take his whole day to meet with each student individually. He is extremely thoughtful and wants to help everyone improve their writing.\u201d\nCourse requirements for ENGL0900 include weekly readings with occasional reading responses, occasional asynchronous discussion during essay conferences, intermittent quizzes on MLA formatting, four papers, and one presentation. The topics for the four papers were freewriting, metawriting, literary analysis, and argumentative writing. Reviewers commended Professor Ward\u2019s very detailed and thoughtful feedback on essays. The course material itself was cited as not very challenging, with some students wishing it had pushed their writing towards more substantial change. While respondents enjoyed assigned readings, they did not necessarily enjoy the in-class activities where they had to write something together with classmates.\nWhat made this section of \u201cCritical Reading and Writing I\u201d so special? Professor Ward! One student praised, \u201cthe class itself is quite a normal English class. What makes it enjoyable is Professor Ward, who is an amazing professor.\u201d Reviewers continually noted the benefits of ENGL0900 being S/NC. With the workload cited as not particularly hard, the S/NC \u201ctakes all pressure on writing the correct essay and instead allows you to make mistakes and grow.\u201d While the course is not stressful, at times students wished it was more challenging. With that, students said \u201cyou get out what you put in,\u201d but overall, students felt it was interesting and helpful in gaining a better perspective on writing.\n\ninstructor: Instructors\nAustin Jackson\naustin_jackson@brown.edu\n\nschedule: Schedule and Location\nMWF 12pm-12:50pm in Page-Robinson Hall 501\n\naverage_hours: 3.50\n\nmax_hours: 6.63\n\ncourse_rating: 39%\n4.13\n\nprofessor_rating: 65%\n4.85\n\nprofessor_and_term: ENGL 0900 | Ward, Robert (S2) | Spring 2021\n\n", "code: ENGL 0930\n\nterm: Fall 2024\n\ntitle: Introduction to Creative Nonfiction\n\ndescription: \u201cIntroduction to Creative Nonfiction\u201d (ENGL0393) is an English course that introduces students to techniques and narrative structures commonly used in creative nonfiction writing. The course focuses on personal essays, memoirs, science writing, travel writing, and other subgenres; it also emphasizes reading material written by authors from a diverse range of identities. Though ENGL0393 has no prerequisites, a writing sample is required, and enrollment is limited. Respondents emphasized that no background in the subject matter was required. The class can serve as preparation for any 1000-level nonfiction writing course within the English department, and it is mandatory S/NC.\nStudents described Professor Michael Stewart as incredibly approachable. They praised his knowledge of \u201cthe most random topics\u201d and appreciated his valuable comments on written assignments, which students described as pleasantly constructive without being mean. In addition, respondents noted Professor Stewart\u2019s spirited demeanor and indicated that he was incredibly responsive to student needs and feedback.\nThe course consisted of weekly reading and writing exercises. Students were also required to write five papers throughout the semester. As one student noted, the class focused on improving writing skills, and there were no penalties for writing something bad, which made for a class environment that encouraged risk-taking.\nOverall, respondents praised this class as a must-take. Students commented that anyone could learn from the course, regardless of writing level. One student particularly enjoyed that the assignments focused on tangible skills, stating that the class was \u201cespecially worthwhile if you\u2019re willing to take risks with your writing and subject material!\u201d\n\ninstructor: Instructors\nKate Schapira\nkate_schapira@brown.edu\n\nschedule: Schedule and Location\nTTh 9am-10:20am in Page-Robinson Hall 202\n\naverage_hours: 3.00\n\nmax_hours: 6.67\n\ncourse_rating: 59%\n4.42\n\nprofessor_rating: 65%\n4.83\n\nprofessor_and_term: ENGL 0930 | Stewart, Michael (S6) | Fall 2022\n\n", "code: ENGL 1030G\n\nterm: Spring 2025\n\ntitle: Backstory\n\ndescription: Everything has a backstory\u2014every object, event or idea.

A mandatory S/NC course, the class is cited as being accessible to all and highly recommended for non-concentrators.

Described as a discussion-based and interactive course with a lot of student participation, ENGL1050E was \"the most welcoming, communal atmosphere I\u2019ve ever experienced in a class,\" according to one respondent. Professor Readey is commonly noted as the most memorable aspect of this course, with numerous students echoing the claim that \u201cProfessor Readey was one of my favorite professors thus far at Brown\u201d due to his kindness and willingness to help his students. An overwhelming amount of respondents appreciated how available the professor was to meet outside of class time.

Additionally, many reviewers thought the course work was very relevant, reasonable, and engaging.\nOne student said ENGL1050E was \u201cpossibly the best course I have taken in terms of aligning with my passions.\u201d In addition, many students saw no flaws in how Professor Readey currently teaches the course, though some reviewers would have appreciated more time to cover sports events and clearer structure, as well as guidelines on how to write specific types of articles.

There are no formal prerequisites, and no previous digital experience is necessary for this course; however, students noted that experience with Adobe software, photo, video, and audio editing, and coding would be helpful, as well as background from a previous WRIT, CS, or MCM course.\nProfessor Stewart (whom the students referred to by first name) received praise as a passionate, well-versed, hilarious, and very enthusiastic lecturer who created a collaborative, receptive, and laid-back environment. One student wrote, \"Michael was extremely passionate about the material. He made coming to class enjoyable and worthwhile.\" However, some students noted that his lectures, while filled with love for the subject, were not specific enough to the course material. Overall, students found Professor Stewart very available and responsive, but wanted more detailed feedback than what they received.\nCoursework consisted of three short projects, assigned one week in advance, and one final project, assigned one month in advance. The projects were open ended, allowing students to explore various forms of digital media - from text to audio to collage to image. Most students found the projects extremely relevant but not difficult, giving them a lot of creative liberty and providing opportunity for growth in a non-restrictive way. Multiple students noted that \"you get out what you put in.\" Weekly readings were also assigned, which students found very relevant to class goals.\nOverall, reviewers thoroughly enjoyed \"Multimedia Nonfiction,\" noting that the class changed their perspective on the possibilities of writing and publishing. However, all students wished that Professor Stewart set aside more time for technical and programming lessons and skills-based discussions. As a supplement to ENGL1050J, students recommended any of Professor Stewart's courses, especially \"Digital Essay,\" and any other MCM or art courses. One student wrote, \"[This class] challenged me to explore equipment and means of media I wouldn't have otherwise.

In this course, we will consider the prison letter as an important genre for racial, social, and economic justice. We will examine rhetorical choices made by prison writers to agitate, posit grievances, assert arguments, and advocate for institutional change. With this insight, we will exchange letters with prison reform activists currently or formerly residing in carceral facilities in the United States.\n\ninstructor: Instructors\nAustin Jackson\naustin_jackson@brown.edu\n\nschedule: Schedule and Location\nMWF 2pm-2:50pm in 70 Brown Street 315\n\nprograms: Curricular Programs\nWriting - Designated Courses (WRIT)\n\ncritical_review_url: http://www.thecriticalreview.org/ENGL/1191B\n\n", "code: ENGL 1311G\n\nterm: Fall 2024\n\ntitle: Shakespeare, Love and Friendship\n\ndescription: Shakespeare portrays friends who are compared to a \"double cherry\"; a lover who wants to cut her beloved out in little stars; and subjects who sweat with desire to see their kings.

This course has no official prerequisites. Respondents agreed that experience with close reading, literary analysis, and essay writing were valuable preparation for the class, though one reviewer also noted that Professor Rambuss helped students improve their skills in all of the aforementioned areas, regardless of previous background.\nProfessor Rambuss received high praise from students, particularly for his effective teaching style and \u201cinfectious\u201d passion for the material. In particular, respondents highlighted Professor Rambuss\u2019s facility in creating a balance between lecturing and class discussion. One reviewer emphasized that Professor Rambuss encouraged all students to share their ideas about the text in seminar discussions and made everyone feel as though they were heard.\nThe coursework consisted of readings, a four- to five-page midterm paper, and an 8 to 10-page final paper. One respondent emphasized that although there were readings assigned for every class, they were not too time-consuming and were both enjoyable and worthwhile. Class members encouraged future students to fully commit to reading and engage with Milton\u2019s more challenging works, such as Paradise Lost.\nRespondents highly recommended this course. Class members cited Professor Rambuss\u2019s engaging teaching methods and careful, coherent guidance of the class as key aspects in their enjoyment.

We delve into this year as both an idea and a watershed moment. Historically, it was the year of the Space Shuttle Discovery\u2019s maiden voyage; ongoing famine in Ethiopia; the continuing Cold War; the Macintosh computer; and the shooting of four African-American teenagers on the New York subway. Culturally, 1984 brought us Ghostbusters and The Terminator; Louise Erdrich\u2019s Love Medicine and Milan Kundera\u2019s The Unbearable Lightness of Being; Prince's Purple Rain; the creation of Tetris; and the rise of the infomercial. By focusing on a single year, we consider how culture and politics intertwine in an unfolding history, and how myths animate lived experience.

By contextualizing Asian American literature in the longer histories of the nineteenth-century \u201ccoolie\u201d trade from China and India to the Americas, we will examine how Asian indentured labor shaped Asian American culture and aesthetics. What might be the relationship among race, representation, literary form, and political economy? How might studying Asian American literature produce new knowledge about concepts such as globalization, freedom, resistance, labor, identity, and belonging?

In this seminar, we study fiction by South African writers who used the English language. The writers address moral and aesthetic questions occasioned by the challenge of trafficking in imaginative literature in a South Africa governed by repressive regimes of white supremacy. At the level of form, they do so in diverse ways. Issues that will engage us include debates around such literary-critical concepts as: protest, realism, modernism, and the \u201cpost-apartheid\u201d in literature. Works by Brutus, Coetzee, Fugard, Gordimer, La Guma, Mda, Ndebele, Paton, Plaatje, and Wicomb.

Should we study a literary work as an entity unto itself, or does context play such a crucial role in the generation of meaning that we mustn\u2019t ignore it?

As this potentially interminable catalogue suggests, the late is not invariably attached to notions of mastery or wisdom, ripeness or completion, as the signifier of a desired end. In Late Style, Edward Said aligned lateness with \"intransigence and unresolved contradiction,\" indeed, with a kind of failure.

The course has no formal prerequisites or necessary prior knowledge, but students noted that \u201cManagement of Industrial and Nonprofit Organizations\u201d (ENGN0090) could provide a helpful background.\nRespondents described Professor Jason Harry as a passionate, attention-grabbing lecturer and a good communicator of information. Professor Harry\u2019s use of live demonstrations and guest lecturers also contributed to his favorable standing amongst reviewers. Students also felt he worked to cultivate a relationship with them by putting in the effort to learn names, encouraging participation, and breaking down complex content for beginners in the field.\nRequirements for the class throughout the semester included weekly readings, six problem sets, a group pitch presentation, two individual projects, a midterm exam, and a final exam. Some reviewers felt that although lectures were easy to understand, exams could be difficult to study for and difficult to take. Despite this, reviewers agreed that the workload was manageable and not too challenging.\nReviews overall reflected positively on their experience in the class. Most had overwhelmingly positive reviews of Professor Harry\u2019s teaching style and although some struggled with class assignments, the majority agreed that the course was not intensely difficult.

The class sets a foundation for further study in engineering by exploring design and analyzing static structures, as well as CAD, basic Matlab programming, and social responsibility. Led by an undergraduate mentor, students complete group design modules, which require an additional two hours of meeting time per week. The official prerequisite for the course is \"Introductory Calculus, Part II\" (MATH0100) or equivalent, though this may also be taken concurrently. However, many respondents reported that having taken physics and calculus was the best preparation one could have for the course, especially for knowledge of vectors.\nProfessor Karen Haberstroh taught ENGN0030. Professor Haberstroh was described as receptive to student questions and needs, and provided plenty of resources for students to get help. However, students noted that her lecture style could be dry, as it was mostly slideshows, though the amount of practice problems done in class was helpful practice. Some respondents suggested that she could add more detail to her explanations of the problems, or tackle more difficult questions in order to prepare students for the exam.\nAssignments for the course consisted of weekly homework and labs, two take-home exams, one individual project over the course of the semester, two group projects, and two papers on design projects (one individual and one group). Weekly readings were assigned but were often dense and difficult to understand; students found that they were not necessary in order to succeed in the class. Respondents advised planning for the fact that lab time does not cover all the time actually needed to complete projects. Class members generally found the assignments both relevant and useful.\nOverall, students who took this course found it to be a useful introduction to engineering principles; some particularly enjoyed the BDW labs. Class members noted that as an intro course, the better at math and physics you are, the easier this course will be. Prospective shoppers are advised to stay on top of their work, and not to be lulled into complacency by the fact that everything is pass/fail. Respondents also recommended shopping \u201cBasic Physics A\u201d (PHYS0030) and \u201cDynamics and Vibrations\u201d (ENGN0040).\n\ninstructor: Instructors\nDaniel Mittleman\ndaniel_mittleman@brown.edu\nMatthew Laderer\nmatthew_laderer@brown.edu\n\nschedule: Schedule and Location\nMWF 9am-9:50am in Bio Med Center 291\n\naverage_hours: 4.96\n\nmax_hours: 10.48\n\ncourse_rating: 32%\n3.38\n\nprofessor_rating: 38%\n4.10\n\nprofessor_and_term: ENGN 0030 | Haberstroh, Karen (S1) | Fall 2021\n\n", "code: ENGN 0032\n\nterm: Fall 2024\n\ntitle: Introduction to Engineering: Design\n\ndescription: Interested in the design of products, services, and systems? \u201cIntroduction to Engineering: Design\u201d (ENGN0032) is an introductory engineering course with a design twist. The class is comprised of lectures, supplementary sections, weekly homework, and projects. As with \u201cIntroduction to Engineering,\u201d (ENGN0030), ENGN0032 is a mandatory S/NC class. As an introductory class, respondents did not feel any prerequisite classes were necessary, though students with some high school physics background were initially more comfortable with the engineering work.\nProfessor Michael Donohue was noted for his passion for design and connecting with students. His teaching style was described as very hands-on and interactive, and respondents found participation in lecture discussions extremely beneficial. Several respondents found his stories to be engaging and practical and considered him as a valuable design resource, especially for projects. However, his lectures only covered \u201cbig-picture\u201d design concepts, while engineering components of the course were covered in sections by undergraduate TAs, which some found made the engineering problem sets difficult.\nThe workload is comprised of weekly design or engineering homework as well as group projects. The engineering problem sets, in particular, could be disorganized. In general, the problem sets could be time-intensive, but the S/NC nature of the class meant the grades were less emphasized. The projects were considered particularly time-consuming but rewarding as they trained both creative and technical skills.\nRespondents believed that ENGN0032 offered a new, non-traditional perspective on engineering, and one student wrote that it has made them consider concentrating in Engineering. Non-concentrators who took the class still found the skills and experiences in the class very useful. Many noted that ENGN0032 is a relatively new and constantly evolving class and that Professor Donohue was very open to improving the class with student feedback. If you plan on developing any products or systems, ENGN0032 is a great class to consider.\n\ninstructor: Instructors\nMichael Donohue\nmichael_donohue@brown.edu\n\nschedule: Schedule and Location\nTTh 10:30am-11:50am in Barus & Holley 168\n\naverage_hours: 5.28\n\nmax_hours: 10.88\n\ncourse_rating: 35%\n3.82\n\nprofessor_rating: 60%\n4.52\n\nprofessor_and_term: ENGN 0032 | Donohue, Michael (S1) | Fall 2021\n\n", "code: ENGN 0040\n\nterm: Spring 2025\n\ntitle: Engineering Statics and Dynamics\n\ndescription: Looking to graduate with a degree in engineering? Then \"Dynamics and Vibrations\" will be a necessary and important part of your engineering curriculum. The course was primarily taught by Professor Allan Bower, along with Professors Jennifer Franck and Thomas Powers. The goal of this course is to reinforce and expand upon basic engineering skills learned in ENGN0030, which is a prerequisite. According to Professor Bower, students who complete this course shall be able to idealize a simple mechanical system, to analyze forces and motion in this system with Newtonian mechanics, to become familiar with vibrations in a one-degree of freedom system, and to apply engineering skills to group design projects. The prerequisite was ENGN0030, and the co-requisite for this course was MATH0200 or MATH0180, Multivariable Calculus. Students found these prerequisites to be adequate, but added that a background in high school or low-level physics was useful.\nStudents found the instructors to have been effective overall. Professor Bower was praised for his engaging and entertaining lectures, Professor Franck was especially praised for her clarity, and Professor Powers was praised for his helpful math hints and concept explanations. While most students found the professors to have been engaging, some responded that lectures could be a bit dry, and that some topics were rushed. Many students appreciated the use of practice problems, but others found this to take away from the organization of class time. Professor Bower tried to incorporate a wide variety of learning styles into his lectures, to try and appeal to the entire class. Outside of class time, the instructors were highly praised for their availability and commitment to seeing students succeed. Office hours were plentiful, and the professors would stay past midnight helping students when a project was due.\nThe workload for this course consisted of one midterm exam, eight problem sets, four design projects with presentations to the professors, and one final exam. Students found the assignments challenging, and attendance at office hours was almost a necessity for understanding the problems. But by working through the problem sets, most students got a better grasp of the course material. There was no assigned reading, but the lecture notes were posted online and were found to have been helpful.\nStudents spent on average eight hours per week on coursework, which jumped to 16 hours during weeks when a project was due. Professor Bower is currently not scheduled to teach this course next year, so there may be changes to the course format and material. But for the future, students would like to see easier problem sets, more conceptual work in lecture, and more efficient TA office hours. Professor Bower wants prospective students to realize that 1) the course is a lot of work, 2) that lecture attendance counts for 10% of the final grade, 3) that help is readily available for anyone who needs it, and 4) that this is a very collaborative class, and that working with others is necessary for success. While most students taking this course are taking it as a concentration requirement, students conclude that it is a course well worth the time and effort.\n\ninstructor: Instructors\nThomas Powers\nthomas_powers@brown.edu\nMiguel Bessa\nmiguel_bessa@brown.edu\nKyung-Suk Kim\nkyung-suk_kim@brown.edu\n\nschedule: Schedule and Location\nTTh 9am-10:20am Location TBD\n\naverage_hours: 8.24\n\nmax_hours: 16.46\n\ncourse_rating: 56%\n4.19\n\nprofessor_rating: 61%\n4.53\n\nprofessor_and_term: ENGN 0040 | Bower, Allan Francis (S1) | Spring 2012\n\n", "code: ENGN 0061\n\nterm: Fall 2024\n\ntitle: Undergraduate Teaching Assistant Apprenticeship: Full Credit\n\ndescription: Being an undergraduate TA is a learning and rewarding experience: Students get a deeper understanding of the course material and gain valuable management, mentoring, and social skills that they can take with them well into the future.

Despite the large class size, many reviewers praised the professors for their willingness to answer questions and interact with students. The class is lecture-based and utilized slides, but the professors encouraged students to be an active part of the discussions. Class members also noted that both professors were passionate and knowledgeable about the material, which made their teaching effective. The course also incorporated guest speakers to describe aspects of real-life organizations.\nThis course consisted of five papers throughout the semester and a take-home final exam, which was also a paper. It also had several readings due every week, many of which were case studies that were discussed during conference sections. Students found the case studies to be \u201cessential for the understanding of the frameworks presented in lecture\u201d and recommended prospective students to begin their papers early. Additionally, there were two Canvas discussion posts per week, which counted as participation in class.\nOverall, ENGN0090 was described as a \u201csuper interesting [course] and beneficial to anyone interested in business and marketing\u201d.

While many liked that he was passionate about the material and enjoyed talking to and hearing from students, respondents generally felt that the course was somewhat disorganized and that the communication was unsatisfactory. Students mentioned that Professor Fleeter tended to go off on long tangents discussing his business experience. Some students found this useful, but others felt that it made it difficult to learn the material, which was otherwise considered enjoyable.\nOn a weekly basis, class members had to complete a one paragraph response to a podcast.

It is part of the engineering core and is usually completed in the third or fifth semester by those concentrating in engineering. There are no official prerequisites, but many respondents mentioned a basic chemistry background, CHEM0330, and the engineering sequence courses ENGN0030, ENGN0040, and ENGN0510 as advantageous.\nThe instructors for the course, Professor Eric Chason and Professor Sharvan Kumar, conducted lectures with PowerPoint slides supplemented by chalkboard work. In general, the professors received good reviews from students. Many respondents praised the professors as passionate and knowledgeable, and the lectures as effective, organized, and detailed. Several students expressed frustration that the notes on the chalkboard were difficult to read at times, and hard to follow. Outside of class, the professors were available at weekly office hours, responded promptly to emails, and posted helpful lecture notes online.\nAssignments for \u201cMaterials Science\u201d included ten weekly problem sets, two labs, one lab report (for both labs), two midterm exams, and one final exam. Most students found the problem sets to be appropriately difficult and relevant to the material, although others considered them very difficult and time consuming. Many thought the exams were quite difficult and time-crunched, and not very similar to the problem sets. As such, several students recommended making the homework and exams more related. The labs received praise for their interesting applications, but the end-of-the-year lab report received criticism for being confusing, long, and \u201ctedious.\u201d In general, though, students considered the assignments relevant and effective in reinforcing the course goals.\nOverall, students found \u201cMaterials Science\u201d to be a fascinating course, the labs particularly so. One unusual aspect of this course is that it meets on Tuesdays and Thursdays, but there is an extra Monday lecture, in addition to a conference section. Several students suggested that the course have less breadth and more depth in the material covered. In addition, many asked for more labs, as well as more guidance on the lab report. Respondents also mentioned that the exams could be easier, and that professors could provide more preparation for the exams. Students shopping this course could also look at CHEM0330 or \u201cBiomaterials\u201d (ENGN1490). \"Materials Science\" is usually taken as a requirement for engineering concentrators. It was technical and difficult for some students, whereas others found it to be reasonably difficult, relevant, and engaging.

The course touches upon topics such as air and water pollution, chemistry fundamentals, mass balance, and solid waste management. The class is essential for students interested in taking higher-level environmental engineering courses and is relevant for students interested in studying the connection between engineering, technology, and sciences. There is one math prerequisite (MATH 0100, 0170, 0180, 0200, 0350, or 0190) and one chemistry prerequisite (CHEM 0100 or 0330).\nCourse instruction consisted of both problem-solving and lecture, which were mixed between presentation slides and handwritten notes. Respondents described Professor Kurt Pennel's teaching style as extremely passionate and effective, noting that he was very successful in accommodating both in-person and remote students. Reviewers also praised Professor Pennel for being very available and responsive to students, providing helpful feedback and always making everyone feel supported.\nCourse requirements consisted of one to two readings per week, five homework assignments (four required and one extra credit), three exams, three labs, and a final project. Students found assignments to be reasonable and worthwhile, noting that although there was a significant amount of work, the workload was manageable as assignments were very fair and directly based on material discussed in class.\nAll respondents reported having a positive experience in ENGN0490, with many commenting that Professor Pennel's passion truly made the class special. Students encourage potential shoppers to take the course, noting that it provides many opportunities for application, and therefore feels more 'real world' and intersectional than any other engineering classes.\n\ninstructor: Instructors\nIndrek Kulaots\nindrek_kulaots@brown.edu\n\nschedule: Schedule and Location\nTTh 1pm-2:20pm in Barus & Holley 163\n\naverage_hours: 3.75\n\nmax_hours: 9.14\n\ncourse_rating: 41%\n4.41\n\nprofessor_rating: 65%\n4.85\n\nprofessor_and_term: ENGN 0490 | Pennell, Kurt (S1) | Fall 2020\n\n", "code: ENGN 0510\n\nterm: Fall 2024\n\ntitle: Electricity and Magnetism\n\ndescription: \u201cElectricity and Magnetism\u201d (ENGN0510) is a course taken by most engineering concentrators studying laws of electricity and magnetism and their applications to engineering. The course consists of lectures, a recitation, and a laboratory component. Its prerequisites include either the first two engineering courses (ENGN0030 and ENGN0040) or two rigorous physics courses (PHYS0070 and PHYS0160), a multivariable calculus course, and a differential equations course (APMA 0330 or APMA 0350), which may be taken concurrently. Students broadly agreed with the necessity of these prerequisites; they stressed the importance of fully comprehending vector calculus and also suggested students who took AP Physics in high school may have an easier time with this course.\nThis semester, Professors Jonghwan Lee and Alex Zaslavsky jointly taught the course. Respondents had favorable reviews of Professor Zaslavsky, who they described as \u201cpassionate\u201d and \u201cfast-paced.\u201d Some reviewers, however, wished he had used slides and paid more attention to ensuring lecture recordings were uploaded correctly so they could more easily review course content. As for Professor Lee, students generally felt his use of slides and slower pace allowed him to treat concepts and examples with more intricacy. Students underscored how the instructors\u2019 teaching styles differed greatly. Although some felt this made the course feel disjointed, one respondent said \u201ctheir teaching styles complement[ed] each other well.\u201d\nFor ENGN0510, students were required to complete ten homework sets, four labs, and three exams. Reviewers warned future students that the lab reports took longer to write than they seemed at first glance. They also emphasized the importance of consistent studying and practice due to the formidable difficulty of the material, the exams, and the assignments. Though challenging, students mostly felt the lectures and assignments provided good preparation for the exams.\nOverall, students found this course worthwhile despite being difficult. Since ENGN0510 is a requirement for most engineering tracks, students suggested those considering taking it ensure their math knowledge is up-to-date before (and during) the first part of the course to prevent needing to catch up later.\n\ninstructor: Instructors\nAlexander Zaslavsky\nalexander_zaslavsky@brown.edu\nRod Beresford\nj_beresford@brown.edu\n\nschedule: Schedule and Location\nMWF 10am-10:50am in Barus & Holley 168\n\naverage_hours: 8.38\n\nmax_hours: 15.62\n\ncourse_rating: 39%\n3.41\n\nprofessor_rating: 65%\n3.79\n\nprofessor_and_term: ENGN 0510 | Lee, Jonghwan and Zaslavsky, Alex (S1) | Fall 2021\n\n", "code: ENGN 0520\n\nterm: Spring 2025\n\ntitle: Electrical Circuits and Signals\n\ndescription: \u201cElectrical Circuits and Signals\u201d (ENGN0520) is an intermediate engineering course that introduces electrical circuits using calculus and ordinary differential equations. Topics covered include the frequency domain, circuit theorems, power transfer, and transient analysis, as well as engineering ethics and real-world applications. The course officially requires only some level of intermediate calculus as a pre- or corequisite, but students felt it was important to have taken low-level engineering core courses, especially \u201cElectricity and Magnetism\u201d (ENGN0510); some reviewers also considered basic linear algebra, physics, and MATLAB knowledge helpful.\nRespondents considered the course\u2019s instructor, Professor Farah Laiwalla, to have a fairly standard teaching style that closely followed the textbook. In lectures, she presented with and wrote notes on a shared screen and answered questions, which students felt was effective but lacked any discussion elements.\nFor this course, students were assigned textbook chapters to read and were required to complete a weekly problem set, five individual labs, two midterm exams, and a final. Reviewers generally found the problem sets and labs difficult and time-consuming. Students noted that these assignments often took longer than expected, as they spent five to ten-hours per week on average on course material and closer to fifteen hours in heavier weeks. They recommended starting assignments early. Some respondents also wished the labs could be done with a partner.\nAlthough many though the course difficult, reviewers found ENGN0520 rewarding and worthwhile for those interested in studying engineering.

Taught by Professor Andrew Peterson and Professor Axel van de Walle, the course covered concepts related to equilibrium, and the zeroth, first and second laws for both closed and open systems. The official prerequisite was \"Introduction to Engineering\" (ENGN0030) or \"Dynamics and Vibrations\" (ENGN0040), which reviewers found appropriate. \"Equilibrium, Rate, and Structure\" (CHEM0330) or \"Materials Science\" (ENGN0410) were also recommended and many students found that a background in chemistry was helpful.\nProfessor Peterson lectured for the first half of the course and was praised for his organization, clarity, and engaging style. Some students felt that his lectures were a bit dry at times. However, many mentioned that he was easily available and helpful at office hours, though many wished he had provided more such opportunities throughout the week. Professor van de Walle lectured for the second half of the course, and many students felt that on many occasions, his lectures moved too fast and repeated material straight out of the book.\nAssignments for this course consisted of ten weekly homework assignments, three labs, one midterm exam, a final exam, and a final design project. Students were split on their assessment of the assignments: some felt that they were not as challenging as they had expected, but were of appropriate difficulty, while some felt that they were too hard. Most agreed, though, that they were very important for learning the material. The final design project was almost universally considered very difficult, and many felt that it was not very useful or relevant to the course goals.\nStudents generally spent between seven and twenty hours per week for this course. The reviews were very mixed, with some students finding the course to be not very hard, and about half finding it quite difficult and time consuming. A common suggestion was that the final project be redesigned to be more in line with the rest of the course, or to be done in groups to make it more manageable. Most students found the material interesting, but many warned prospective students of the heavy workload.\n\ninstructor: Instructors\nRobert Hurt\nrobert_hurt@brown.edu\nG Tayhas Palmore\ntayhas_palmore@brown.edu\n\nschedule: Schedule and Location\nTTh 10:30am-11:50am Location TBD\n\naverage_hours: 7.17\n\nmax_hours: 20.74\n\ncourse_rating: 46%\n3.52\n\nprofessor_rating: 52%\n3.95\n\nprofessor_and_term: ENGN 0720 | Peterson, Andrew (S2) | Spring 2014\n\n", "code: ENGN 0810\n\nterm: Fall 2024\n\ntitle: Fluid Mechanics\n\ndescription: \u201cFluid Mechanics\u201d (ENGN0810) is an intermediate engineering course that covers properties and flow of fluids and hydrostatic forces, including their grounding in more basic concepts of conservation in physics. The course\u2019s prerequisites are multivariable calculus, a course in differential equations, and either ENGN0040 or an introductory physics course. Of these, students found calculus and physics the most necessary to succeed.\nThe course was co-taught by Professors Daniel Harris and Roberto Zenit, both of whom were highly regarded for their teaching styles, as well as their ability to be accommodating and supportive. Reviewers described Professor Harris\u2019s lectures as more straightforward, while Professor Zenit\u2019s lectures included more humor, visual aids, and demonstrations. Students felt that these lecture styles complemented each other well and remained well-coordinated throughout the semester. The only common suggestion, directed at both instructors, was to use clearer handwriting or type lecture notes.\nCoursework consisted of eight problem sets, three midterm exams, four labs with lab reports, and textbook readings. Labs were completed in groups of four. Respondents agreed that this high-volume workload was very time-consuming but worthwhile. They stressed that office hours were helpful for gaining conceptual understanding and clarifying instructions both on homework and lab reports. The exams were considered reasonably difficult; a few class members expressed gratitude that the instructors had been willing to change the last exam from a three-hour final into a third in-class midterm.\nOverall, students greatly enjoyed ENGN0810 despite its considerable difficulty.

His lectures were chalkboard-based, and he often taught new concepts by demonstrating several examples of a problem. Most respondents wrote that he was clear and organized and that his examples were helpful. Some, however, wrote that he explained concepts poorly and that he did not provide enough examples. A further criticism, which was expressed by many, was that his lectures were too fast and contained too much derivation at the expense of examples. Professor Gao\u2019s availability outside of class was generally limited. However, this was counteracted by the readily available TA, whom the students found extremely helpful.\nThe assignments for the course included eight homework sets, one open-note midterm, and one open-note final. The difficulty rating of the homeworks, which accounted for 50% of the final grade, ranged from \u201cappropriately challenging\u201d to \u201cvery difficult\u201d. Students generally said, however, that the homeworks were relevant to the course, and several noted that they were cumulative in terms of material, so that course content was reinforced every week.

Students looking to take ENGN1931T should already have an idea in mind for their venture. However, it is not an independent study class, as there are general class assignments as well. Though there are no official prerequisites for the course, students found previous courses in economics, sociology, and mathematics helpful. Students not concentrating in Business, Entrepreneurship, and Organizations (BEO) or Economics, or without a strong business foundation, may find it difficult to keep up with the methods and concepts. In addition, work experience in business and/or the chosen venture field helped some students dive deeper with their ventures. Other entrepreneurship classes such as \u201cThe Entrepreneurial Process\u201d (ENGN1010) serve as good supplementary classes.\nWith this emphasis on prior experience, students were very appreciative of Professor Jonas Clark's approachable nature and accessibility outside of class hours. The lectures were informative, and most classes included an open discussion element. Professor Jonas\u2019s feedback helped students move quickly with their ventures, as both the professor and TA often worked one-on-one with students. The environment created in the class was praised for focusing on the students\u2019 potential long-term success rather than the short-term weaknesses. One student described Professor Clark as \u201cthe professor you hope to have every semester.\u201d\nStudents agreed that assignments significantly aided them in their ventures, and the weekly readings were very useful. On average, students spent around five hours outside of class on the course, with a maximum of around ten hours.\nOverall, students highly enjoyed ENGN1931T, though some wished for more industry-specific advice for their personal ventures. Multiple students described the course as a full commitment, though it is up to the student to decide how difficult they wish the course to be; as the saying goes, \u201cyou get what you put in.\u201d Many advised that experience combined with a clear venture idea was central to the class and cautioned against taking ENGN1931T for students just starting to explore business.\n\ninstructor: Instructors\nAbigail Kohler\nabigail_kohler@brown.edu\n\nschedule: Schedule and Location\nTTh 1pm-2:20pm in 1 Euclid Ave, Nelson Ctr Entr 210\n\naverage_hours: 7.67\n\nmax_hours: 13.33\n\ncourse_rating: 41%\n4.38\n\nprofessor_rating: 66%\n4.94\n\nprofessor_and_term: ENGN 1931T | Clark, Jonas (S1) | Spring 2021\n\n", "code: ENGN 1931W\n\nterm: Fall 2024\n\ntitle: Selling & Sales Leadership in the Entrepreneurial Environment\n\ndescription: Planning a startup?

The official prerequisites for this class are ENGN0090, ENGN0900, ENGN0020, or ENGN1010. Reviewers noted that having experience with Harvard Business School case studies and general knowledge of business is helpful.\nProfessor Howard Anderson was praised for his passion for and knowledge of the entrepreneurial world, all coming from his personal experience. Students noted that the course consisted of roleplaying cases and freeform lecturing where Professor Anderson would often relate relevant, humorous stories. The lectures were also aided by PowerPoint presentations. Some students mentioned that while these stories were engaging, the course could feel disorganized at times. Outside of class, he was available to meet through appointment, but there were no set office hours.\nThe major coursework consisted of case readings, weekly assignments that alternated between PowerPoint presentations or short sales videos, and two papers that were 1500-2000 words in length. Reviewers found that there were no clear guidelines for the work and no clear grading rubric, both of which made the assignments feel a bit more difficult. Students stated that the work was relevant but very time-consuming. Most believed that having more extensive feedback would help clarify the assignments more.\nAll in all, students recommended this course for Professor Howard\u2019s insightful perspective on the business world. Many students appreciated his business acumen and believed what they learned was very applicable to the real world. However, almost all students also suggested that the grading and expectations should be explicitly outlined, since most assignments were returned with few comments.

From this foundation, we explore on-the-ground efforts toward land justice, including decolonization, reparations, agrarian commons, and land trusts. Students will leave the course with frameworks for envisioning and helping to build equitable, just, and healthy Land futures based in stewardship, intention, and care.\n\ninstructor: Instructors\nMindi Schneider\nmindi_schneider@brown.edu\n\nschedule: Schedule and Location\nTTh 2:30pm-3:50pm Location TBD\n\nprograms: Curricular Programs\nRace, Power, and Privilege (RPP)\n\ncritical_review_url: http://www.thecriticalreview.org/ENVS/1232\n\n", "code: ENVS 1247\n\nterm: Fall 2024\n\ntitle: Clearing the Air: Environmental Studies of Pollution\n\ndescription: *Please note that this course was taught online \u2013 this review may not be reflective of future semesters*\nInterested in the sources of pollution and how they can be effectively managed? Consider \u201cClearing the Air: Environmental Studies of Pollution\u201d (ENVS1247), an interdisciplinary overview of issues relating to pollution. The course has no formal prerequisites, and reviewers encouraged students of all backgrounds to shop it. That said, some reviewers found it helpful to have background knowledge in chemistry, sociology, or environmental justice theory.\nThis course was taught by Professor Scott A Frickel and Professor Meredith K Hastings. Reviewers praised both professors for their engaging lectures and skillful facilitation of discussions. Students also enjoyed hearing from guest speakers whom they thought were well-prepared. Several respondents noted that Professors Frickel and Hastings created a welcoming and comfortable space for discussion and encouraged them to ask questions of the guest speakers. In general, students enjoyed the shared teaching style.\nCourse requirements consisted of reading assignments, Canvas responses, and several written assignments. The readings were primarily research papers, drawing from the hard sciences and the social sciences. While they did not find the Canvas discussions difficult, students thought they were less effective than synchronous discussions. This course was WRIT-designated and required students to write three five-page papers, one midterm paper, and a final paper.\nRespondents thought that this class was a great balance between lecture content and discussion. Although the class moved quickly at times, students felt that they learned a lot about pollution and that they received a valuable introduction to other environmental problems.

Modern agriculture has become incredibly productive, fueling the global grain trade, the meatification of human diets, and the exponential expansion of food and non-food products. Still, the number of people who are hungry, food insecure, and/or malnourished is stable or increasing in various parts of the world. As global population rises, calls to further increase and intensify agricultural production ring out across the globe. Through (agro-)ecological, feminist, and justice lenses, we will explore the political economy of food insecurity and agriculture, the political ecology of agricultural development, and critical humanist approaches to the past, present, and future of farming.

Throughout the semester, students learn about the importance of urban agriculture and community gardens by delving into research and readings, and working on projects relating to farm policy, food access, and labor practices. There are neither formal prerequisites nor background needed for the class.\nENVS1555 was taught by Professor Dawn King whom respondents described as approachable, knowledgeable, and kind. Professor King taught primarily through PowerPoint lectures which were found to be at times disengaging, and students were left wanting more guidance. This also led students to feel that the PowerPoints were \u201credundant, repeating information that was already in the homework\u201d. Students enjoyed Professor King's incorporation of guest speakers, allowing the class structure to vary from week to week.\nThe coursework for this class consisted of multiple weekly readings, discussion posts, and reading responses. There was a short paper for the midterm, but more importantly, the overarching group project of the course was the involvement in an Engaged Scholar Project, where students worked with a community partner to apply the topics discussed in class. Though students found the projects to be a notable amount of work outside of class, many underscored that it was exciting to go into depth into a particular topic that they were curious about.\nOverall, students enjoyed ENVS1555 for Professor King\u2019s enthusiasm and the thorough introduction the course provided for food systems, policy, and case studies. Respondents advise that the work is totally worth it if that material is something that genuinely interests you. If one is wanting to have a balance between a lecture-style and project-led course, this is a great choice.

Students learn to develop initiatives for increasing sustainability and resiliency of these systems in anticipation of climate change, process technical aspects of environmental stewardship, and gain skills in policy analysis and program implementation. Respondents commented that prior experience with courses in environmental science or urban studies was helpful but by no means necessary to succeed.\nProfessor Kurt Teichert's style of teaching included lecture slides, breakout room discussions on Zoom, and student presentations on case studies which students found to be incredibly interesting and engaging. One reviewer commented that Professor Teichert was \"the kindest, most passionate, most interesting, most genuine professor\", emphasizing that he truly wants students to learn and appreciate the material rather than memorize technical definitions or stress about grading. Others also felt that he made good use of class time in a virtual setting and was very accommodating to students' needs in and out of the classroom.\nAssignments for this course consisted of readings each week, papers, three take-home exams, and one group project. Reviewers found the readings to be accessible and the group project to be enjoyable and low-stakes but reflective of most of the work done throughout the semester.\nAll in all, class members were fond of the course and recommended it to any prospective students interested in the topic regardless of concentration.

How do we understand the category \u201cLatinx Art\u201d and its history? How have the expressive iterations of different communities reflected on community dynamics and politics? How do contemporary curatorial projects provide platforms to envision Latinx futures? Departing from the cultural expressions linked to US Latinx civil rights movements of the 1960s and 1970s, this class will dwell on diverse formal and thematic approaches and foci in contemporary US Latinx Art to reflect more broadly on the ideological impact of expressive culture. We will do so by studying the expressive culture of artists in the United States of Latin American descent as well as the interdisciplinary critical scholarship of art history and visual culture scholars.

We will center Native American voices and stories to resist and reject the tradition of U.S. origin stories that perpetuate Native absence in order to produce American national fantasies of democracy, civilization, and progress. Native American novels, short stories, and poetry will be our scenes to reflect on, critique, and contest the ongoing project of settler colonialism in the United States. Our goal is to attend to individual and tribal experiences of life under settler colonialism, and consider the political, social, and psychological conditions that this structure produces. By the end of the course, students will have gained an understanding of Native American history and federal Indian policy, the Native American literary canon, and key debates in the field of Native American Studies.\n\ninstructor: Instructors\nBrandi Bushman\nbrandi_bushman@brown.edu\n\nschedule: Schedule and Location\nTTh 2:30pm-4pm in Nicholson House 101\n\nprograms: Curricular Programs\nRace, Power, and Privilege (RPP)\nWriting - Designated Courses (WRIT)\n\ncritical_review_url: http://www.thecriticalreview.org/ETHN/0090D\n\n", "code: ETHN 0601A\n\nterm: Fall 2024\n\ntitle: Introduction to Asian American History\n\ndescription: This course provides an introduction to the histories of people of Asian descent in the United States from the late 18th century to the present.

Through its comparative angle, the course aims to allow students to understand the similarities and differences within Latinx communities and provide them with a foundation for further exploration in Latinx literature. There are no prerequisites to the course; reviewers noted that the skills learned in a high school literature course could adequately prepare a student for this course.\nProfessor Ralph E. Rodriguez was praised to be an especially passionate, accommodating, and energetic instructor. In each class, he posed challenging questions to students for them to hold class discussions on. An important point to note is that many of the readings included explicit and potentially triggering content; Professor Rodriguez would not provide trigger warnings before each reading but made clear that students could tell him if they wished for him to point out specific triggers. Students also noted that he made very clear that he wished to be a support system for students and thus made himself available outside class time to offer support.\nStudents were assigned a short story to read for each upcoming class. They were expected to read the story twice and arrive prepared with questions and thoughts to discuss with the whole class. In terms of bigger assignments, students were assigned three papers throughout the semester, which constituted the great majority of a student\u2019s grade. The first was a four-page paper, while the second and third were five to seven pages\u2014although, for the third assignment, students could propose a creative project if they so chose to.\nOverall, students had an amazing time in the course. However, they noted that although it is a very manageable course workload-wise, prospective students should only enroll if they are \u201cinvested in the class, not just to get an easy A.\u201d\n\ninstructor: Instructors\nRalph Rodriguez\nralph_rodriguez@brown.edu\n\nschedule: Schedule and Location\nTTh 10:30am-11:50am in Sayles Hall 002\n\nprograms: Curricular Programs\nRace, Power, and Privilege (RPP)\nWriting - Designated Courses (WRIT)\n\naverage_hours: 3.20\n\nmax_hours: 9.20\n\ncourse_rating: 59%\n4.42\n\nprofessor_rating: 79%\n4.93\n\nprofessor_and_term: ETHN 1200D | Rodriguez, Ralph (S1) | Fall 2021\n\n", "code: ETHN 1200K\n\nterm: Fall 2024\n\ntitle: Introduction to Native American and Indigenous Studies\n\ndescription: This class examines and introduces the politics, cultures, histories, representations, and studies of the Native peoples of North America, with a primary focus on the United States, and helps students to develop critical thinking, reading, and writing skills regarding Native American and Indigenous Studies. Although broad in cultural and geographic scope, the course does not attempt to summarize the diverse cultures of the hundreds of Native American tribes across the continent or Indigenous peoples globally.

The course, taught by Professor Kevin Escudero, also focuses on the heterogeneity of movement participants represented in campaigns and political protest. There are no prerequisites for this course, although some students cited prior coursework in ethnic studies, public policy, sociology, and anthropology as being helpful.\nReviewers described Professor Escudero as a knowledgeable, friendly, and highly effective lecturer who articulated ideas clearly and with enthusiasm. The class was largely discussion-based with some lectures, and students noted the professor\u2019s encouraging attitude toward questions and the ability to lead discussion well. A couple of students, however, remarked that they would have preferred a little more structure and lecturing as opposed to discussion. Most of the students also commented on the professor\u2019s easy accessibility outside of class hours, high quality of feedback, and approachable personality.\nCoursework for the class consisted of weekly reading assignments, weekly journals, a community-based internship, and a research paper. Some students felt that the assignments were relevant to course goals, and generally manageable, though some noted that expectations for assignments tended to be unclear and the readings dense.\nStudents found the community engagement aspect of the course to be memorable, along with the professor\u2019s passion for the subject. A couple mentioned that the class could be improved with fewer readings and more organization, as well as clearer guidelines for assignments. Students recommended prospective shoppers try out \u201cIntroduction to American/Ethnic Studies\u201d (ETHN0500) and \u201cRace and Remembering\u201d (AMST1700D), as well as other ethnic studies courses.\n\ninstructor: Instructors\nKevin Escudero\nkevin_escudero@brown.edu\n\nschedule: Schedule and Location\nTh 4pm-6:30pm Location TBD\n\nprograms: Curricular Programs\nRace, Power, and Privilege (RPP)\n\naverage_hours: 4.48\n\nmax_hours: 7.95\n\ncourse_rating: 61%\n4.58\n\nprofessor_rating: 75%\n4.72\n\nprofessor_and_term: ETHN 1750A | Escudero, Kevin (S1) | Spring 2016\n\n", "code: ETHN 1751C\n\nterm: Fall 2024\n\ntitle: Sexy Good Medicine: Sex, Gender, and Indigeneity in (the) America(s)\n\ndescription: In this course, we will immerse ourselves in the academic field of Indigenous Gender and Sexuality Studies.

Knowledge of other Romance languages helps, but is definitely not required.\nThe TA, Claudia Esposito, received good reviews for her enthusiasm and understanding. Students praised her explanations and easy-going nature. She varied lessons, using different themes to teach new vocabulary and grammar. Class members felt that Claudia was very sensitive to their interests and made efforts to help individual students when they fell behind. The frequent class discussions helped greatly helped improve their speaking skills. However, they found some of the dialogues read aloud in class to be boring and repetitive.\nNearly all reviewers thought the test was useful but that some of the assignments seemed to be busy work that was unnecessary. Additionally, there were daily homework assignments, one project and written paper, and frequent presentations in class. Students found the weekly quizzes to be helpful but were disappointed when they did not count for their grade.\nThe number of hours spent outside of class on this course varied between two to five per week.

Many respondents indicated that they took French classes in high school before enrolling in this course.\nStudents praised the instructor, Clint Bruce, for being engaging, friendly, and energetic. Reviewers were especially happy that Bruce told them tactfully when their grammar was flawed: students appreciated this feedback and felt that they benefited greatly from it. Respondents were also very pleased that their instructor was available during office hours and through email, although they were less pleased about their section leader's availability. Some wished that Bruce had simply called on people instead of waiting for volunteers during class; others wished that there had been more mandatory in-class oral presentations and group work to give students more outlets for practicing their speaking skills.\nAs with most language courses, homework was assigned daily. In addition, there were five tests and two compositions. Students felt that these were useful and made up a course load about as difficult as they had expected. Several respondents wished, however, that they had more opportunities for them to be critiqued on their speaking and writing. In addition, reviewers would have liked to have been given clearer expectations on how the tests were going to be graded, as they were evaluated more harshly than they had expected.\nFor those with some background in French and motivation to prepare outside of class, FREN0300 will advance grammatical and expressive ability.\n\ninstructor: Instructors\nStephanie Gaillard\nstephanie_gaillard@brown.edu\n\nschedule: Schedule and Location\nMF 11am-11:50am in Barus & Holley 157\nTTh 9am-10:20am in Sayles Hall 002\n\naverage_hours: 4.13\n\nmax_hours: 8.67\n\ncourse_rating: 57%\n4.24\n\nprofessor_rating: 60%\n4.49\n\nprofessor_and_term: FREN 0300 | Bruce, Clint (S1) | Fall 2009\n\n", "code: FREN 0400\n\nterm: Fall 2024\n\ntitle: Intermediate French II\n\ndescription: Sorry \u2013 this course has data but no review!

Fluency is the ultimate goal, and French culture and media is frequently employed in the course as a means of achieving it. \"Intermediate French II\" or the equivalent level of proficiency and comfort in the language is a prerequisite for enrollment.\nFlorian Gargaillo was described as an absolutely excellent instructor: he was active, effective, and encouraging. Students loved the comfortable, friendly environment that the professor created in class, and felt his skill in engaging lively discussions kept them interested. One respondent found that the \u201cclass felt like chatting in French with friends,\u201d and all appreciated the ease in participating, as it helped with language practice. Students found Florian not only well-versed in the material, but also approachable in office hours, and appreciated his high-quality and prompt feedback.\nAssigned readings for the course varied. Students agreed that all were at the appropriate level of difficulty for their proficiency, but found that some books were better and more relevant than others. In terms of the movies required for the course, many students would have preferred French subtitles over English. Assignments for the course included four to five exams, four to five papers, two oral exams, and a project. Reviewers agreed that this was a lot of work, but it was worth it, and necessary to be constantly working in the language in order to learn.\nStudents generally spent about five hours a week outside of the classroom on this course, and agreed that it was useful. The course comes highly recommended as a way to continue learning French and in an engaging environment.

A number of students appreciated her prompt responses to emails, and thought she was quite available outside of class, holding frequent office hours. Some respondents remarked favorably upon the quality of her feedback.\nFREN0600 had a variety of assignments during the semester. Class members were required to read two books of their choosing and one play, in addition to completing weekly shorter reading assignments. They had two oral exams, one for each of the novels they read. There were five short essay assignments over the course of the semester: two in-class essays, and three out-of-class essays. In addition, students wrote five journal entries and completed grammar and vocabulary exercises. On the whole, respondents found the assignments appropriately difficult, and thought they corresponded nicely with the course objectives.\nOverall, reviewers had a positive experience in FREN0600, in large part, it seemed, because of the quality of the instruction.

Students said that the French language sequence (FREN0100) through (FREN0600) or prior fluency in French was absolutely necessary to succeed in the course, and found 1000-level classes in any language additionally helpful.\nProfessor David Wills was described as a knowledgeable, effective instructor. He used a conversational tone throughout the class, and was not afraid to take the small group in new directions. His analysis was insightful, and occasional participation of the students in the analysis was enjoyed. He was very helpful during his office hours and in email, and was willing to help students catch up after a missed lecture.\nAssignments for the class consisted of readings of various French poets, a five-page short paper, a take home midterm, and a ten to twelve-page final paper. They were seen as manageable and average for a class of this type. As is typical, some assignments were more difficult than others, and most students agreed that the midterm was slightly challenging due to the twenty-four hour time constraint.\nAll in all, the vast majority of students enjoyed the time spent on the course. Respondents unanimously wished for more discussion time and a greater level of engagement with students in the class, but found the more positives than negatives. Particularly memorable from this class were the poets and poetry collections chosen. Students recommended other one-thousand level classes to shoppers, such as \"Histoire de la Langue fran\u00e7aise: Usages, Politiques et Enjeux du fran\u00e7ais\" (FREN1020A) and \"Ateliers d'\u00e9criture\" (FREN1610A).\n\ninstructor: Instructors\nDavid Wills\ndavid_wills@brown.edu\n\nschedule: Schedule and Location\nTTh 2:30pm-3:50pm in 101 Thayer Street (VGQ 1st fl) 116D\n\nprograms: Curricular Programs\nWriting - Designated Courses (WRIT)\n\naverage_hours: 4.00\n\nmax_hours: 8.40\n\ncourse_rating: 61%\n3.79\n\nprofessor_rating: 71%\n3.97\n\nprofessor_and_term: FREN 1130G | Wills, David (S1) | Fall 2017\n\n", "code: FREN 1310P\n\nterm: Spring 2025\n\ntitle: La th\u00e9orie f\u00e9ministe en France\n\ndescription: From Olympe de Gouges to the movement called #Balancetonporc (the French version of #MeToo), from the first-wave feminism to the queer third-wave feminism, from the debates on abortion to pornography, prostitution, and gender parity, this course will explore major texts in French and francophone feminist theory (Simone de Beauvoir, Monique Wittig, Luce Irigaray, Julia Kristeva, H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Cixous, Virginie Despentes, Sam Bourcier, Paul B.

L\u2019identit\u00e9 fran\u00e7aise en question\u201d (FREN1410F) is a course which explores the concept of French identity in contemporary society. Professor Ourida Mostefai leads discussion on the role of identity in both fictional and non-fictional works. As this class is conducted entirely in French, students cited FREN0600 (or equivalent language experience) as essential background.\nProfessor Mostefai began class with either a presentation of the day\u2019s reading or a more general lecture on the topic being discussed. She then opened the floor to discussion, although a handful of reviewers wrote that she dominated the conversation. In general, students felt that Professor Mostefai had a lot of knowledge and personal insights to share, and they asserted that the class was never one-dimensional. Professor Mostefai provided informative feedback on assignments and was receptive to students\u2019 questions.\nThis course\u2019s assignments consisted of daily readings, periodic Canvas discussions, two short papers, a presentation, and a final eight-page paper. Readings were well organized and stayed relevant to the course\u2019s main themes. The majority of reviewers found the workload challenging, mostly because the readings were often dense and long, but a smaller group of students found these assignments relatively easy.\nRespondents\u2019 main critiques of this class targeted the volume of reading and the limited time set aside for students to speak during discussions. Nonetheless, they really enjoyed this course. Many students audited FREN1410F in Spring 2016, and shoppers should consider this option if they are interested in participating in this class without the full workload.\n\ninstructor: Instructors\nOurida Mostefai\nourida_mostefai@brown.edu\n\nschedule: Schedule and Location\nTTh 10:30am-11:50am Location TBD\n\nprograms: Curricular Programs\nWriting - Designated Courses (WRIT)\n\naverage_hours: 2.88\n\nmax_hours: 6.69\n\ncourse_rating: 41%\n4.34\n\nprofessor_rating: 61%\n4.57\n\nprofessor_and_term: FREN 1410F | Mostefai, Ourida (S1) | Spring 2016\n\n", "code: FREN 1410I\n\nterm: Spring 2025\n\ntitle: Sorcellerie et Renaissance: le sort de la sorci\u00e8re\n\ndescription: An interdisciplinary exploration of witches and witchcraft in Renaissance France based on close analysis of primary texts-confessions from trials, iconography, literary texts, and witchcraft theory.

From political theory to philosophy and history, Africa is at the heart of a burgeoning body of theory that this course sets out to examine. The singularity of this course resides in the fact that it will maintain, a continental perspective that includes the Maghreb or North Africa within Africa throughout the semester. Emphasis will be placed on French-speaking sources from West and North Africa, which are often neglected in English-speaking contexts. The need for such a perspective is represented by Frantz Fanon\u2019s Pan-Africanism, which calls for the abolition of the Saharan frontier between \"North\" and \"Black\" Africa.

Les philosophies de la diff\u00e9rence par-del\u00e0 l'Europe\n\ndescription: The relationship between deconstruction and the decolonization of knowledge does not date back to the 1980s and the development of postcolonial studies. They can be found among authors such as Abdelkebir Khatibi and Edouard Glissant, among others, as far back as the 1970s. So, instead of considering that deconstruction preceded decolonization, shouldn't we be thinking the other way around? Isn't deconstruction rather an effect of decolonization, particularly in Algeria after 1962? From a conceptual point of view, has deconstruction not been constituted in relation to the very idea of a decolonization of knowledge, to the point, perhaps, of being nothing more than a way of formulating this imperative, which today resonates in the depths of human science disciplines in the process of de-provincialization?

Indeed, many of the questions currently debated in this field are by no means new, and literature has long been a central medium for grappling with the challenges posed by the vegetal. The dual mission of this seminar will be to: 1) critically assess major texts in the emerging field of plant studies and 2) trace the evolution of literary representations of vegetal life in French and Francophone literatures from the 16th century to the present.

Both posed persistently and explicitly the question of literature. For Barthes, this involved putting literary texts to the test of new forms of analysis based on structuralist and semiological research, while arguing for a discipline that exposed \u201cthe place and energy of the [reading] subject.\u201d Derrida often used literature to challenge traditional philosophy, and play a double-agent role within his sense of \u201cwriting,\u201d while also analyzing its resources on their own terms, revealing criticism\u2019s lack of both rigor and adventure, and relating literary questions to high stakes political and ethical questions.

The course aims to \u201cconsider how sexuality and gender are shaped in relation to race and ethnicity, economic inequality, and the postcolonial legacy.\u201d There are no prerequisites for this class, and while some students felt a background in reading theory was useful, most felt adequately prepared by their personal experience.\nThis course was taught by Professor Denise David. Students wrote extensively about Professor Davis\u2019 warmth, liveliness, and passion in lectures. Many enjoyed her use of personal anecdotes and felt they helped keep the class engaged, but some reviewers noted her tendency to stray off-topic. Several students found Professor Davis\u2019 lecture slides a bit lackluster, but students broadly found her lectures informative and illuminating with regard to class readings.\nCoursework consisted of weekly readings and discussion posts, two papers, a midterm exam and a final exam. Many reviewers found the readings difficult but rewarding, with many noting the importance of attending lectures to fully understand each week\u2019s reading. A few respondents sometimes felt Professor Davis did not fully explain readings in her lectures, and stressed the role of discussion sections in fully digesting the course material. As one student noted, \u201cIt is a lot of reading but I could literally feel my brain getting bigger. It was amazing.\u201d\nOverall, students felt the course provided a solid foundation of gender and sexuality theory, and felt enriched by the complex concepts covered in the class. Some reviewers wished readings were simplified or reduced, and that Professor Davis would explain them more thoroughly in lecture. One student also indicated it would be helpful to include more everyday applications of the material. However, most students enjoyed the course and felt it gave them insight into present-day issues of gender and sexuality, as well as the theoretical background of these issues.\n\ninstructor: Instructors\nWendy Lee\nwendy_lee@brown.edu\n\nschedule: Schedule and Location\nMWF 2pm-2:50pm in Smith-Buonanno Hall 106\n\nprograms: Curricular Programs\nWriting - Designated Courses (WRIT)\n\naverage_hours: 4.81\n\nmax_hours: 8.88\n\ncourse_rating: 37%\n3.89\n\nprofessor_rating: 59%\n4.39\n\nprofessor_and_term: GNSS 0120 | Davis, Denise (S1) | Fall 2021\n\n", "code: GNSS 0710D\n\nterm: Fall 2024\n\ntitle: Sapphic Arts: From Poetry to TikTok\n\ndescription: This course takes an intimate look at Sapphic culture from the late 19th century to present. Since its most recent renaissance in the mid-2010s, the Sapphic has emerged as an elusive disruptor; an umbrella term that welcomes lesbians, wlw, nonbinary and trans femmes and mascs. This seminar explores how the Sapphic functions not just as an identity category but a methodology (a way of reading, writing, looking, listening) and an aesthetic in art, design, fashion, and food. What are the ways in which the Sapphic works with/against lesbian and queer political identities? How does contemporary use of the Sapphic diverge from its past iterations in literature, literary criticism, and visual culture? How might we understand temporality in Sapphic expression (slow-burn, yearning)? Competency in Sapphic arts requires participation in seminar discussions, completion of 3 short essays, and a final essay/creative project.\n\ninstructor: Instructors\nHelis Sikk\nhelis_sikk@brown.edu\n\nschedule: Schedule and Location\nTTh 1pm-2:20pm in Pembroke Hall 202\n\ncritical_review_url: http://www.thecriticalreview.org/GNSS/0710D\n\n", "code: GNSS 1400\n\nterm: Fall 2024\n\ntitle: Agnotology: The Will to Ignorance\n\ndescription: If the will to knowledge is a will to power, what of the will to not know?

This course considers epistemology from the perspective of what we don\u2019t know, what we refuse to know, and what we can\u2019t know.

Our arts of survival focus on racial and sexual difference as determining factors in living and dying, while considering the labors of sustenance, the affects of suffering, the aesthetics of ruination, and the (im)possibility making the unbearable bearable. Students will develop a comprehensive view of interdisciplinary art practice (including performance, installation, sculpture, memoir, fiction, and poetry) while exploring their own arts of endurance, memorialization, and medicine.\n\ninstructor: Instructors\nSarah Richter\nsarah_richter@brown.edu\n\nschedule: Schedule and Location\nM 3pm-5:30pm Location TBD\n\nprograms: Curricular Programs\nRace, Power, and Privilege (RPP)\n\ncritical_review_url: http://www.thecriticalreview.org/GNSS/1962C\n\n", "code: GNSS 1990\n\nterm: Fall 2024\n\ntitle: Senior Seminar\n\ndescription: A research seminar focusing on the research and writing of the participants.

Can we speak of any single methodology that ties GNSS together? How might scholars working on gender/sexuality acknowledge disciplinary boundaries and use disciplinary training effectively? We will start with the premise that studies in gender and sexuality are tied together by questioning foundational assumptions within a given field of knowledge and taking account of our own subject positions vis-\u00e0-vis our objects of study. By studying canonical theoretical texts alongside disciplinary studies characterized by a feminist and/or queer focus, we will investigate how gender and sexuality are constructed in various contexts, what kind of work they do, and how standards of evidence are marshaled in particular disciplines. Particular attention will be given to the role of critique, affect, and materialisms, including the materiality of language, in gender and sexuality studies.\n\ninstructor: Instructors\nDenise Davis\ndenise_davis@brown.edu\n\nschedule: Schedule and Location\nTh 1pm-3:30pm Location TBD\n\ncritical_review_url: http://www.thecriticalreview.org/GNSS/2000\n\n", "code: GNSS 2010R\n\nterm: Fall 2024\n\ntitle: Pembroke Research Seminar - Unwriting the Anthropocene: A Call to Experiment\n\ndescription: This seminar experiments with form to think about writing and poetics as modes of embodied experience.

Then \u201cEssentials of the Greek Language\u201d (GREK0100) is for you! The course is a two-semester approach to learning the ins and outs of ancient Greek, starting from its grammar and leading all the way to its literature. There are no prerequisites for the course, but some students stated that having some background in Latin helped them.\nProfessor Stephen Kidd received spectacular reviews from respondents. The class is structured around a lecture about grammar followed by a discussion of the homework assignments. Students reported that his casual lecturing style, humor, and enthusiasm made the course very engaging. Also, reviewers enjoyed that he incorporated conversations about Greek culture and linguistics into the lectures. Students found that Professor Kidd was very available and always happy to help.\nThe workload consisted of daily homework assignments concerned with conjugations, declensions, and translations, three review quizzes, one midterm, and one final. Respondents noted that the homework could be time-consuming and moderately difficult, but all of it was highly relevant and made to help you develop a strong grasp on the language.\nProfessor Kidd and his passion for ancient Greek and its culture is reason enough for students to take this course. Reviewers praised him for his humor, stories about the ancient Greeks, and creative use of a stuffed octopus as a tool to practice the conjugation of verbs. Some students suggested that TA sections could have been more structured and that the lectures could have delved a bit further into the importance of accent marks, but for the most part, the course was perfect as is. Reviewers advised those interested in this course to make study groups and to study the vocabulary frequently. Also, students who enjoyed this class should look into \u201cVirgil: Aeneid\u201d (LATN1040B) and \u201cEssentials of the Latin Language\u201d (LATN0100).\n\ninstructor: Instructors\nTBD\n\nschedule: Schedule and Location\nMWF 9am-9:50am in Page-Robinson Hall 201\n\naverage_hours: 7.60\n\nmax_hours: 9.20\n\ncourse_rating: 72%\n4.50\n\nprofessor_rating: 87%\n4.90\n\nprofessor_and_term: GREK 0100 | Kidd, Stephen (S1) | Fall 2018\n\n", "code: GREK 0300\n\nterm: Fall 2024\n\ntitle: Introduction to Greek Literature\n\ndescription: \u201cIntroduction to Greek Literature\u201d (GREK0300) is an intensive reading class that has students delve into Classical Greek prose. This course emphasizes translation and comprehension in an effort to deepen one\u2019s understanding of the language. The course uses Plato\u2019s Symposium as the primary text. Official prerequisites to this course are GREK 0200, GREK 0110, or the equivalent. Most reviewers had taken the official prerequisites, though some say having intensive Greek language courses in high school prepared them for the material.\nProfessor Fennerty received mostly positive reviews about her preparedness and passionate teaching. Students noted that she was incredibly intelligent and very effective when the class worked on their translations. Some students remarked that she could be a bit disorganized and get off-topic, but overall, her instruction was impactful. All reviewers also expressed that she was easily available outside of class and provided good feedback.\nThe coursework for this class included one translation exercise per class, biweekly quizzes, two midterm exams, one final, and one final project and presentation. Each translation assignment ranged from 20-30 lines of text. Reviewers found that the material was moderately difficult, but they all noted that this was necessary to learn the language.\nMany students found that the greatest takeaway of this class was having such a passionate professor. Reviewers were divided over the primary text, as some found reading the Symposium and its various philosophies a noteworthy experience, while others found that they greatly disliked the text but grew more skilled in Greek through studying it. One reviewer also suggested that the final presentation should be shortened from 20 minutes. Overall, this course is recommended for all who want to improve their Classical Greek, and students suggested shopping upper-level Greek classes or courses in the Classics department if you\u2019re interested in this material.\n\ninstructor: Instructors\nTBD\n\nschedule: Schedule and Location\nTTh 9am-10:20am in Page-Robinson Hall 302\n\naverage_hours: 3.83\n\nmax_hours: 10.67\n\ncourse_rating: 51%\n4.42\n\nprofessor_rating: 55%\n4.80\n\nprofessor_and_term: GREK 0300 | Fennerty, Caitlin (S1) | Fall 2019\n\n", "code: GREK 1111K\n\nterm: Fall 2024\n\ntitle: Aristotle's Theology in Metaphysics Lambda\n\ndescription: Metaphysics Lambda (Book XII) is a self-contained series of lectures presenting in its first five chapters an overview of Aristotle\u2019s natural philosophy and metaphysics (first philosophy) and culminating in its last five chapters in his tantalizing treatment of divine substance and its causal role in the cosmos.

Class members found her feedback on homework and other assignments particularly helpful. One student, however, complained that class time was sometimes dribbled away on irrelevant issues.\nStudents had homework to be handed in at each class period, consisting mostly of translation. This took a mean of eight hours weekly, although some whizzed by in four and others labored for fourteen. According to one respondent, the dated textbook offered only dry, repetitive exercises and badly needs replacing.\nIn short, most students were satisfied with their own improvement through this course, although some suggested that a good class on translation might be a better use of one's time.

As class participation was an essential element of the course, students never lacked opportunities to interact closely with the instructor as well as with one another. Respondents praised Professor Fornara for effectively managing in-class activities: he frequently stepped back to allow students to work out difficult problems on their own, but readily interceded when necessary.\nClass members enjoyed the majority of assigned readings, identifying Homer\u2019s works as particularly helpful and the lyric fragments as less helpful in achieving course objectives. Grades for this course were determined in a fairly unconventional way: students had no assignments or exams, but were evaluated based on their in-class performance. One respondent expressed confusion regarding the assessment criteria.\nThe amount of time students spent preparing for this course varied dramatically, though the majority devoted ten or more hours each week. They found that the demanding nature of the course greatly enhanced their understanding of Greek literature.

This introductory-level course allows students to achieve an A2 level in German and gain a deeper understanding of German culture, history, and life. There are no official prerequisites for this course, although some students did note that knowing a small amount of German contributed significantly to success.\nProfessor Jane Sokolosky, whom students called Frau Sok, was widely praised for her passion in teaching German. According to students, Frau Sok\u2019s interactive presentations and patience allowed them to effectively and comprehensively develop their German skills. Additionally, students noted that Frau Sok made the course immersive by speaking only German and that they were able to build a strong foundation in German by the end of the semester.\nAssignments for this course included daily homework assignments derived from the course textbook, as well as some presentations and projects. There were also in-person written and oral exams throughout the semester to test students\u2019 understanding of recent chapters and lessons. Prospective students are advised to memorize and study new vocabulary and grammar concepts before every class to effectively learn a new language.\nOverall, students highly recommended this course to those interested.

Students noted that Professor Haubrich strongly encouraged practice through partnered speaking activities and class discussions, which were incredibly helpful in learning and understanding the course content. Respondents also noted that Professor Haubrich was generally available outside of class and that both the professor and TAs were very responsive to emails. However, students found that the class often moved at a very fast pace.\nCourse requirements included daily readings and online exercises, as well as weekly Canvas discussions, in-class exams, and vocab quizzes. There were numerous projects throughout the semester, as well as one oral exam. Reviewers claimed that assignments sometimes felt useless and time-consuming but were not too difficult as long as students kept up with the work.\nStudents felt that the course could be improved by having updated course materials and less repetitive learning modules. Many respondents recommended taking this course and other similar intensive language courses, citing a real growth in practical language capabilities as well as cultural appreciation.

The only prerequisite is GRMN0100, which is the first semester of this course. Reviewers generally agreed that no other course, aside from GRMN0100, was necessary to perform well in the class, although prior experience with learning a foreign language was noted to be generally helpful.\nWhile the course is listed as being taught by Professor Jane Sokolosky, graduate student Ethan Lussky, known to students as \u201cHerr Lussky,\u201d was primarily responsible for instruction. Students praised Herr Lussky for being a funny, energetic, and engaging lecturer. Respondents also noted that Herr Lussky\u2019s expansive etymological knowledge was helpful in understanding German grammar. Reviewers found that Herr Lussky was eager to help both inside and outside of the class and that the German immersion was very helpful to their learning.\nCourse assignments included readings on German culture, discussion posts on Canvas, daily homework assignments, four written exams, vocabulary quizzes through Quizlet, a final German film project, and a final cumulative exam. Many respondents found the assignments to be very helpful in expanding their knowledge of German grammar and vocabulary. Despite the breadth of assignments, respondents did not find the workload to be overly challenging or time-consuming.\nStudents enjoyed GRMN0200 and felt that they learned a surprising amount about German culture and language.

One reviewer also noted that prior German studies in high school helped a lot with this course.\nClass members referred to Professor Jonathan Fine as \u201cHerr Fine\u201d and described him as an effective lecturer. Students appreciated Professor Fine's encouragement during discussions and receptiveness to questions. In particular, one participant stressed his clear instruction style, emphasizing that he skillfully guided students through activities that were relevant to language topics. Many found readings varied and interesting, noting that Fine's incorporation of readings into class helped contextualize them.\nIn terms of coursework, the class features two homework assignments every week, eight vocabulary quizzes, three papers, two in-class exams, and one individual project on StoryMap. In addition, students are also required to read short passages after every class, write responses regularly, and post their discussions on the Canvas page.\nOverall, students really enjoyed Fine's course and appreciated the course introducing them to a broader world of German history, literature, philosophy, and many more \u201cpotential academic interests.\" Respondents recommended the course for those with adequate German knowledge and a willingness to embark on in-depth cultural endeavors.\n\ninstructor: Instructors\nJonathan Fine\njonathan_fine@brown.edu\n\nschedule: Schedule and Location\nMWF 10am-10:50am Location TBD\nTh 12pm-12:50pm Location TBD\n\nprograms: Curricular Programs\nWriting - Designated Courses (WRIT)\n\naverage_hours: 5.33\n\nmax_hours: 8.33\n\ncourse_rating: 42%\n4.46\n\nprofessor_rating: 66%\n4.94\n\nprofessor_and_term: GRMN 0400 | Fine, Jonathan (S1) | Spring 2022\n\n", "code: GRMN 0500F\n\nterm: Fall 2024\n\ntitle: Twentieth-Century German Culture\n\ndescription: \u201cTwentieth-Century German Culture\u201d (GRMN0500F) offers students the opportunity to broadly explore a century of German culture via a variety of written and visual texts spanning \u201cliterature, journalism, film, and art.\u201d Respondents noted that this was very different from previous German language courses they had taken at Brown as the focus was not exclusively on learning the language. Instead, students were asked to critically discuss complex works. Students were expected to have taken GRMN0400 or equivalent prior to taking the course. While many students noted this was sufficient preparation, others also found German heritage and/or time spent in Germany to be useful.\nReviewers found Professor Jonathon Fine to be an effective instructor who led an interesting and efficient course. He was clear on valuing learning and participation over standard testing and tried to ensure that every student had an enjoyable experience. Classes were often discussion-based which many students liked. One critique students had was that they wished more course time was devoted to covering culture and history. At times, respondents also felt that the vocabulary being taught was not the most practical or useful for everyday use.\nRespondents felt that course assignments were intriguing and necessary to properly participate in class. These generally consisted of pre-class readings, biweekly reading responses, daily homework, weekly quizzes, and one or two projects that students could choose to complete individually or in a group. Respondents felt that the workload was reasonable and that it helped them get the most out of the course.\nOverall, students enjoyed the GRMN0500F, with graduate student Jasmin Meier garnering particular praise for the invaluable assistance she offered throughout the semester.

Almost 50 years later, Jacob Grimm delivers a lecture under a similar yet slightly\u2013\u2013and decisively\u2013\u2013different title: Das Wort des Besitzes, dealing not only with the history and semantics of the word Besitz but with the word itself.

In German-language literature, political models of society, psychological theories on the dynamics of thinking and feeling, and critical discussions of history are often negotiated on the basis of an outline of what childhood is. This is because studying how humans develop promises to provide insight into what it means to be human and permits one to construct images of how humans should live. This line of thought breaks from a centuries-old convention of equating children with animals due to their lack of articulate speech and regretting this phase. In this course, we will read key texts of German-language literature from the Enlightenment to the present day that expound childhood as a special, formative epoch of individual life that, at the same time, grants insight into social dynamics.\n\ninstructor: Instructors\nTBD\n\nschedule: Schedule and Location\nTTh 1pm-2:20pm Location TBD\n\ncritical_review_url: http://www.thecriticalreview.org/GRMN/1441O\n\n", "code: GRMN 1441P\n\nterm: Fall 2024\n\ntitle: What Are We Looking At?

Additionally, students who had taken \u201cIntroduction to Architectural Design Studio\u201d (HIAA0100) found their previous experience useful if they chose an architectural model for the final project.\nProfessor Dietrich Neumann was noted for his extreme passion for the material and ability to connect architecture to the architect, location, or time period being studied. Several students described Professor Neumann as \u201cone of the best lecturers at Brown,\u201d and his engaging storytelling made the lengthier 80-minute classes quite interesting.\nAssignments included weekly readings and three response papers. Two quizzes were given in section, where students were asked to memorize the name, architect, date of construction, and location of buildings.

This class emphasizes the development of students\u2019 listening, speaking, and reading skills, with some focus on writing skills.\nProfessor Snider proved to be a master at her craft. Class members found her to be an enthusiastic and knowledgeable instructor who brought a good level of clarity and sensitivity to the course. She encouraged student questions and made the class very interactive by emphasizing participation amongst her students. The small class size permitted a high level of personal interaction and made the class a supportive and cohesive one.\nReviewers mentioned that, in addition to four exams, there were four quizzes, three writing compositions, a weekly language lab, and daily workbook assignments. The textbook for \u201cBasic Spanish\u201d was seen as very clear and useful to the goals of the course. Some students felt that the cultural readings, while interesting, would have been more useful had they been discussed more extensively in class.\nOn average, most respondents spent about five hours a week on outside work for the class, although the amount of time varied greatly from person to person. Opinions on the difficulty of the coursework ran the gamut of \u201cI thought I would have to work harder\u201d to \u201cway too many hours.\u201d Don\u2019t let this deter you, though; if you have the desire and the time to learn Spanish, \u201cBasic Spanish\u201d is the way to go.\n\ninstructor: Instructors\nSilvia Sobral\nsilvia_sobral@brown.edu\n\nschedule: Schedule and Location\nMW 9am-9:50am in Smith-Buonanno Hall 101\nTTh 9am-10:20am in Smith-Buonanno Hall 207\n\naverage_hours: N/A\n\nmax_hours: N/A\n\ncourse_rating: 31%\n4.44\n\nprofessor_rating: 53%\n4.65\n\nprofessor_and_term: HISP 0100 | Snider, Sara (S2) | Fall 2008\n\n", "code: HISP 0200\n\nterm: Spring 2025\n\ntitle: Basic Spanish\n\ndescription: \"Basic Spanish\" (HISP0200) is the second of six intensive classes at Brown meant to teach students the Spanish language. This particular section was taught by Mai, Professor Silvia Sobral's TA, and met four days per week. In order to take this class, you need either proper testing placement or to have taken HISP0100 previously. The majority of respondents had taken Spanish in high school, and some had taken the preceding course at Brown.\nMai was well-liked for her engaging teaching style, her friendly and accommodating attitude, and the positive work environment she created. The course was taught in Spanish, but students reported that Mai was patient and made sure everyone understood what was going on. She also held regular office hours, gave good feedback, and graded assignments very quickly.\nHISP0200 required students to complete short daily homework, weekly online homework, three papers, occasional quizzes, three non-cumulative exams, and a final project. Students indicated that assignments were very relevant to class material and, while time-consuming, not especially difficult (except for exams). Time commitment for this class was generally around six to seven hours per week, ten at the most.\nRespondents highly enjoyed class with Mai, even if it was a lot of work. Though it was difficult at first, students came to appreciate that the course was taught in Spanish, as they felt it helped them learn more. Some would have liked a little less strict grading or perhaps opportunity for extra credit, but not much else. One student advised that, as this is a very grammar-heavy course, you should try getting into HISP0300 if you feel that you already understand this topic.\n\ninstructor: Instructors\nSilvia Sobral\nsilvia_sobral@brown.edu\n\nschedule: Schedule and Location\nMW 9am-9:50am Location TBD\nTTh 9am-10:20am Location TBD\n\naverage_hours: 6.38\n\nmax_hours: 10.13\n\ncourse_rating: 42%\n4.47\n\nprofessor_rating: 65%\n4.88\n\nprofessor_and_term: HISP 0200 | Sobral, Silvia (S2) | Spring 2018\n\n", "code: HISP 0300\n\nterm: Fall 2024\n\ntitle: Intermediate Spanish I\n\ndescription: If you\u2019ve mastered the basics of the Spanish language, but want to learn more, you may want to consider Spanish 30. In \u201cIntermediate Spanish I,\u201d students are expected to expand their vocabulary, develop oral profi-ciency, writing skills, and broaden their cultural understanding of the His-panic world. The prerequisite for this class is Spanish 20 or equivalent placement.\nNuria Cabre-Bores was praised by her students for being energetic and welcoming, as well as for being willing to explain difficult concepts in English for anyone who asked. At times, some students felt that she spoke too much English, and some students felt her grading policy was unclear. Students felt she really listened and took into account their needs and inter-ests, and her being a native speaker was an added and appreciated bonus. They felt she made the language fun and intriguing for them, and her lessons were always clear and left a great deal of room for student participation, which was highly encouraged by Ms. Cabre-Bores.\nThe course reviewers had to complete two oral and written exams, two quizzes, three 1-page compositions, and give short oral presentations. In addition, there were daily readings and assignments from the lab manual. Many of the respondents felt that the textbook used in the class was less than satisfactory and that the readings were not useful. Some wished that more time had been given to examining culture, especially with more movies and music in class.\nStudents spent roughly three to five hours on this course outside of class, which increased to about six to eight hours on test and paper weeks. This amount is what most students expected to spend. Reviewers on the whole greatly enjoyed this class, and recommended it to anyone who wanted to improve their Spanish. Many of them highly recommended taking the course with Ms. Cabre-Bores.\n\ninstructor: Instructors\nNeus Vila\nneus_vila@brown.edu\n\nschedule: Schedule and Location\nMW 10am-10:50am in Smith-Buonanno Hall G18\nTTh 10:30am-11:50am in Smith-Buonanno Hall G18\n\naverage_hours: N/A\n\nmax_hours: N/A\n\ncourse_rating: 87%\n4.35\n\nprofessor_rating: 50%\n4.31\n\nprofessor_and_term: HISP 0300 | Cabre-Bores (S1) | Spring 2005\n\n", "code: HISP 0400\n\nterm: Fall 2024\n\ntitle: Intermediate Spanish II\n\ndescription: \u201cIntermediate Spanish II\u201d (HISP0400) is part of the introductory series of language-learning courses offered by the Hispanic Studies department. In taking HISP 0400, students should expect to gain a stronger command of linguistic and communicative skills while deepening their understanding of the multicultural Hispanic world. The prerequisites include either \u201cIntermediate Spanish I\u201d (HISP 0300), SAT II scores between 520 and 590, or a Brown Placement exam score between 411 and 490. Familiarity with aural comprehension is expected, as the class is taught entirely in Spanish.\nProfessor Florencia Chiaramonte received rave reviews from her students, not just for her instruction but also for the warm, friendly environment she helped cultivate in her class. One respondent attested to this: \u201cFlor was genuinely one of the kindest teachers I\u2019ve ever had,\u201d they wrote. Students described most of Professor Chiaramonte\u2019s teaching as effective, specifically praising the mixed structure of presenting material at the start of class and then turning to activities that resembled textbook work and discussions for improving communication skills. However, one student noted that the student presentations that took place every other week in class did not feel like effective use of instruction time. Still, respondents emphasized that the instruction helped them develop or rekindle their abilities in Spanish communication while also creating bonds between members of the class.\nSince this class meets every day and assignments are published daily, the workload of HISP 0400 can appear heavy at times. However, respondents noted that the work is not difficult and the grading is \u201cvery generous.\u201d Professor Chiaramonte focused the class on five units, assigning an individual project, a group project, and a take-home quiz for each. Most of the grammar and vocabulary are intended to be self-taught using resources the professor provides. In general, students emphasized that students should expect to put consistent effort into keeping up with the course, although it should never feel overwhelming.\nUnder Professor Chiaramonte\u2019s instruction, the overall consensus is that students at the advanced-intermediate level looking to improve their Spanish abilities should take this course. From the many in-class activities and discussions to the long hours grinding out grammar structures, students are bound to advance. And if you are unsure about your passion for Spanish, perhaps the friends you will make throughout the duration of the course will help you find that motivation.\n\ninstructor: Instructors\nEva Gomez Garcia\neva_gomez_garcia@brown.edu\n\nschedule: Schedule and Location\nMW 10am-10:50am in Page-Robinson Hall 401\nTTh 10:30am-11:50am in Page-Robinson Hall 401\n\naverage_hours: 3.83\n\nmax_hours: 6.50\n\ncourse_rating: 55%\n4.17\n\nprofessor_rating: 73%\n4.56\n\nprofessor_and_term: HISP 0400 | Chiaramonte, Florencia (S2) | Fall 2022\n\n", "code: HISP 0490A\n\nterm: Fall 2024\n\ntitle: Spanish for Health Care Workers\n\ndescription: \"Spanish for Health Care Workers\" (HISP0490A) is a course meant to prepare students intending to work in the health care field with Spanish-speaking patients. The course's objectives are for students to review grammar, learn Spanish vocabulary relevant to medicine, and gain cultural competence in dealing with Hispanic communities. The only formal prerequisite for this class is \"Intermediate Spanish II\" (HISP0400), though many students indicated that taking public health classes or Spanish classes in high school also prepared them for this course.\nStudents liked that Professor Jill Kuhnheim was passionate about the material and covered a wide range of topics relating to healthcare. Many class members appreciated how Professor K, as she was called by the students, was able to foster lively discussions during class, and that she took into account every student's opinions in a respectful manner. While some students said her feedback on assignments could be unclear, other students stated that she made valuable comments on papers. Respondents also agreed that Professor K was very available during office hours.\nCourse assignments consisted of weekly readings, two quizzes, two presentations, two short interview papers, one film review paper, one midterm, and a final exam. Most respondents found the assignments feasible and relevant to the course goals, though some students wished they were given better grading criteria for the papers. On average, students spent four hours per week completing assignments, and at most eight hours while preparing for papers and exams.\nOverall, students really enjoyed the interdisciplinary nature of the course. Class members also really loved the guest lectures and how applicable the class was to the healthcare field. Reviewers advised potential shoppers to stay on top of reading and grammar assignments and study vocabulary frequently in order to succeed in the course. Students recommended any student with an interest in pre-health careers and Spanish language to consider taking this course. Students who took this course also recommended taking other courses in the Spanish sequence or other courses offered by Professor K such as \"Health, Illness and Medicine in Spanish American Literature and Film\" (HISP0750Q).\n\ninstructor: Instructors\nJill Kuhnheim\njill_kuhnheim@brown.edu\n\nschedule: Schedule and Location\nMWF 11am-11:50am in Page-Robinson Hall 501\n\naverage_hours: 4.08\n\nmax_hours: 7.91\n\ncourse_rating: 55%\n4.17\n\nprofessor_rating: 73%\n4.53\n\nprofessor_and_term: HISP 0490A | Kuhnheim, Jill (S1) | Fall 2018\n\n", "code: HISP 0500\n\nterm: Fall 2024\n\ntitle: Advanced Spanish I\n\ndescription: \u201cAdvanced Spanish I\u201d (HISP0500) makes use of various media, such as news articles, music, and film, in order to expose students to authentic language and increase their vocabulary, speaking, and writing skills in Spanish.

The prerequisite for taking this class is \"Intermediate Spanish II\" (HISP0400) or an appropriate placement score.\nReviewers were very happy with Professor Nery Villanueva\u2019s in-class discussions, writing that they were great for reinforcing and improving their speaking abilities. Some would have liked to devote more class time to grammar instruction; most grammar practice were done individually using the class\u2019s workbook. However, students praised Professor Villanueva's timely and useful feedback on assignments.\nAssignments in HISP0500 include three essays, three exams, and various reading, listening, and grammar exercises. Occasionally, students are asked to read news articles or watch movies, which are later discussed in class. All students are also required to give one brief presentation and to attend weekly conversation sections with an undergraduate TA. Respondents expressed that at times the volume of work could get fairly large; however, they felt that individual assignments were not overly difficult.

The prerequisite for this class was Spanish 50 or equivalent AP-level placement.\nProfessor Wey-Gomez was very passionate about the subject matter of the course and this came across in his lectures. Students had different opinions about how he organized class time. Many found his lectures to be very interesting. Other students noted how Professor Wey-Gomez sometimes went off on tangents - they would have appreciated having more class discussion instead. According to respondents, Professor Wey-Gomez did the most that he could to account for these difficulties and was sensitive to the varying levels of fluency. He asked many questions and encouraged participation in class.\nThe students thought that the assigned novels and books were the most useful readings in the course. Class members uniformly concluded that the films added a great amount to the class. Respondents noted that the reading was often dense, long, and difficult to complete. Class participants had to write three six-page papers. Most of the respondents were happy with this amount of work, although some wished that the papers were more spaced out.\nStudents generally spent two to ten hours per week working on the assignments for this class. This varied greatly depending on their level of fluency in Spanish. Some respondents indicated that they did not come close to completing all the reading for the course, while others thought that the amount assigned was fine. However, overall, the respondents highly recommended this class, stating that it was very interesting. They also thought that Professor Wey-Gomez was a very sensitive and insightful professor.

Reviewers noted that prior experience with Spanish in high school and a general interest in Spanish literature to be useful.\nProfessor Ana Garriga was described as being enthusiastic and invested in both her students and the success of the course. She spent class time alternating between lectures and discussions within smaller groups. Students praised her not only for her passion and extensive knowledge on the subject area, but also for her response to the in-person to online switch and the flexibility and support she gave the class.\nIn HISP0740, there were assigned readings for each class, occasional quizzes throughout the semester, two term papers, and one final paper. Students found that the readings were relevant to course material, and although at times a bit advanced, the class quizzes helped to further nail down the material. In general, Professor Garriga was a fair grader and students noted that even if you did not participate as often, you could still succeed through strong written work. Students spent on average 5 hours preparing for class each week.\nOverall, students highly recommend taking HISP0740 for the engaging course material and the passion that Professor Garriga shares with the class.

Uninterrupted contact produced richly complex patterns of cultural exchange whose legacy is variously embraced and debated today. This first-year seminar will examine relationships between Muslims, Jews, and Christians from the perspectives of literature, music, art, architecture, archaeology, and history. While largely focusing on the centuries of co-existence, we will also consider the expulsions and forced conversions of Jews and Muslims that took place after 1492, as well as the resurgence of these communities in contemporary Spain. Throughout, students will acquire theoretical bases for understanding current interreligious conflict and for envisioning its repair.

HISP0600 is a prerequisite, as the course is taught in Spanish.\nProfessor Jill Kuhnheim was described as laid-back, approachable, and excited about the material. A few students commented that although lectures were not always the most engaging, she was great at giving feedback on assignments and was very available to meet with students outside of class.\nThe course assignments consisted of weekly readings, two-to-three-page short responses to readings, two analytical papers three to four pages in length, an in-class midterm exam, and a final paper or project. Students were also required to conduct an ethnographic interview in which they talked to someone from a Spanish speaking country about their experiences with illness and/or cultural beliefs around medicine in that country. The consensus among class members was that assignments were not too difficult but always relevant and interesting.\nMany students cited the discussions surrounding narrative empathy in medicine as the most noteworthy aspect of the class. A few students of the class felt it could be improved in the future by adding more engaging assignments or activities related to the material, as well as allowing for more small group work.

Respondents emphasized their passion and knowledge visible for the subject in all of their lectures and in the weekly discussion sessions they had with students. They were praised for their organization, response to feedback, and efficiency during lectures. Many noted that the professors\u2019 co-teaching of this course enabled them to each present differing, yet equally interesting perspectives on varying topics, which enriched and diversified the content. Many students lauded their unique teaching styles, which made \u201cthe lectures ... simply incredible.\u201d\nThe coursework consists of several weekly readings, two papers, one midterm, and one final exam. Students found these readings to be notably time-consuming, though very interesting and certainly relevant to the course\u2019s lectures.

Course themes deal with the experience and meaning of imprisonment, judicial punishment, political repression, and war's fallout. No previous knowledge is required.\nStudents praised Professor Amy Remensynder as an exceptional lecturer. She was very knowledgeable and passionate, and students admired her ability to make such a large lecture course engaging. Her lectures were structured and organized, and her lecture outlines were especially helpful in class and in preparing for exams. One respondent praised Professor Remensynder\u2019s capacity to handle difficult subject matters, stating that many of the lectures were \u201cinteresting, and, even when emotionally difficult, handled by Professor Remensynder in a very respectful and educational manner.\u201d As one student said, \u201cshe\u2019s just incredible and passionate about teaching!\u201d\nCoursework consisted of weekly readings (around 150 pages/week), five two-page papers (the first of which was ungraded), one midterm, and one final, with the option to choose between a research paper, research project, or an in-class exam. Students\u2019 main qualm with the course was the amount of reading, which respondents emphasized could be time-consuming. However, despite the extensive amount of reading, respondents regarded it as very relevant and worthwhile, especially if you\u2019re interested in the subject. Additionally, Professor Remensynder did not allow the use of electronic devices during class time.

Most reviewers generally felt that Professor Jacobs was an effective instructor. However, one reviewer found that Professor Jacobs\u2019 thematic approach to the material made it difficult to keep track of the chronology of events. \u201cAfrican Experiences of Empire\u201d is a flipped course, meaning students read the relevant materials on their own while class time is devoted mostly to discussion and an occasional lecture.

Throughout, we explore the pivotal role of this region\u2014and narratives about its past\u2014from a variety of \u201c3D\u201d perspectives: water, soil, fossil fuels; governance and trade; religion/spirituality, law, and family life; art, literature, music, and sports; and nationalism, militarism, humanitarianism, and environmentalism.\n\ninstructor: Instructors\nFaiz Ahmed\nfaiz_ahmed@brown.edu\n\nschedule: Schedule and Location\nMWF 11am-11:50am in Salomon Center 202\n\ncritical_review_url: http://www.thecriticalreview.org/HIST/0246\n\n", "code: HIST 0252\n\nterm: Fall 2024\n\ntitle: The American Civil War\n\ndescription: This course, covering the period roughly from 1820-1865 and focusing mostly on 1860-1865, examines the origins of the Civil War, the war itself, and preliminary efforts at reconstruction during wartime. The class meetings and readings will focus on the transformation wrought by the war, investigating in particular certain issues relevant to current affairs: 1) enslavement, emancipation, and struggles for equality; 2) sectionalism, secession, and insurrection; 3) the role of law in the prosecution and resolution of war; and 4) the role of the Civil War in American popular culture and politics.

The course also looks at genocide as manifestations of imperial, racial, colonial, communist, anti-communist, and post-colonial violence and at how genocide has been conceptualized by leaders and their subjects. The course wraps up with a study of how genocide has been prosecuted and punished by the international community. The course is an introductory course and has no prerequisites. Reviewers noted that no background knowledge is needed to succeed in the class.\nProfessors Omer Bartov and James Wang were praised for their passion and knowledge of the subject matter. Particular praise was given to Professor Bartov\u2019s lectures due to his extensive experience studying genocide. Class time consists of lectures and group discussions. Some students noted that lectures could sometimes repeat information that was in assigned readings and that lectures could be dense as a result of the instructors\u2019 fast pace. Still, respondents found the lectures were informative and especially enjoyed the group discussions in each class.\nCourse assignments consisted of weekly readings, weekly reading responses, two three-page papers, and one ten-page final paper. Reviewers noted that the weekly readings could be challenging due to their length and depressing subject matter, but reviewers found the weekly readings to be relevant to coursework. Students spent around five hours every week on coursework outside of class.\nThough the class could be difficult because of its subject, respondents found \u201cModern Genocide\u201d to be worthwhile.

The course explores popular culture in Latin American and Caribbean societies, and according to the course description, the course \"offers a compelling lens onto the relationship between state and society in Latin America and beyond.\" Though there are no official prerequisites, many students said that some background knowledge in Latin American history was helpful for success in the course.\nStudents praised Professor Lambe for her \"coherent, clear, and super eloquent\" lectures. Students also appreciated the professor's enthusiasm in class, which she showed by prompting and guiding provocative discussions. When it came to the professor's availability outside of class, respondents were divided. While Professor Lambe was willing to answer questions and provide feedback, students found her office hours too crowded, and claimed it was difficult to schedule individual appointments.\nCoursework included one cultural ethnography group presentation, one reading response (3-4 pages), one map quiz, one midterm paper (5-7 pages), and one final paper (13-15 pages). On average, students found the assignments reasonable and relevant to the course material. However, some respondents reported that the readings were often too dense and lengthy.\nOverall, students highly recommended this class because it is \u201cvery unique and eye-opening.\" One improvement that students suggested was to divide the single class period per week into two shorter ones.

The course considers the revolutions in British North America, France, Saint-Domingue, and Spanish America as part of a singular era of intellectualism, imperial reform, violence, and newly emerging politics. This course is writing-designated. Some respondents cited a background in American and European history as helpful for the course, but there are no official prerequisites.\nProfessor Jeremy Mumford was praised by respondents for being extremely accommodating, supportive, and compassionate. Respondents emphasized that he was always receptive to new ideas and willing to meet during office hours to talk through issues. The course was organized into two sections. The first section was lecture-based and covered the material explored in the readings. Though effective, some respondents felt this portion of the class was sometimes too concise. The second section of the class was discussion-based, and Professor Mumford was praised for his ability to facilitate student discussions.\nThe course was structured through four to six readings per week, which respondents said often amounted to over 100 pages of reading. There were also weekly online discussions about the readings due before class. The course assignments included several reading comprehension quizzes and one 10-15 page research paper at the end of the semester.\nWhile respondents agreed that they learned a lot from this course, they warn prospective students that the class is very reading\u2013 and discussion\u2013intensive and the work can sometimes feel tedious.\n\ninstructor: Instructors\nJeremy Mumford\njeremy_mumford@brown.edu\n\nschedule: Schedule and Location\nM 3pm-5:30pm Location TBD\n\nprograms: Curricular Programs\nFirst Year Seminar (FYS)\n\naverage_hours: 6.25\n\nmax_hours: 10.00\n\ncourse_rating: 38%\n4.03\n\nprofessor_rating: 61%\n4.58\n\nprofessor_and_term: HIST 0580M | Mumford, Jeremy (S1) | Fall 2021\n\n", "code: HIST 0657A\n\nterm: Fall 2024\n\ntitle: Early American Lives\n\ndescription: This is a writing-designated (WRIT) course that examines the intersection of biography and history.

Reading scholarship in environmental and disability history and relying on a diverse array of primary sources, this course traces relationships between bodies, minds, and land in the U.S. over the past 200 years. Through histories of slavery, animal labor, wilderness preservation, atomic radiation, disability and environmental activism, and COVID-19, we will ask how human and nonhuman bodies were made and unmade in processes of environmental change indoors and out, how the political meanings of disability, incapacity, and productivity were constructed over time, and what a just future for disabled life and the nonhuman world might entail.

Intense ideological clashes in the U.S. paralleled the wave of authoritarian regimes, armed struggles, and revolutions in Latin America. While each country had to contend with its own history and particularities, from the Lavender Scare to the Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo notions and anxieties about gender and sexuality appear as a connecting thread of regional conflict. In this course, we will examine how ideas about gender were a central battleground for the political transformation of the region. We will consider how states and institutions employed conservative gender ideologies as avenues of political and individual control, while shifting ideas about gender also served as avenues for the activation of new political subjects.

We also explore the range of visions for how to do away with apartheid and what should come after it. The dramatic story of struggle ended with what some considered a near-miraculous resolution in 1994.

We begin with the study of ancient political ideas, for it is during the earliest periods of Chinese history that the greatest variety of government modes are proposed. Political philosophy is the focus, but we also examine the institutions that were developed to translate ideals into action and to the tensions that arose as a consequence of efforts to reconcile different political philosophies in practice during the imperial period.

Topics covered include identity, comparative colonialism, experiences of decolonization, and citizenship. Although there are no official prerequisites, respondents found previous classes in East Asian history and basic background knowledge of Asian history helpful, but not essential.\nHIST1120 is a combination of lecture and discussions. Students praised Professor Rebecca Nedostup for her clear and efficient slides, vast knowledge of this topic, and passion during lectures. Although reviewers noted that the class may be a bit disorganized at times, they liked how Professor Nedostup successfully encouraged discussions. Although reviewers had mixed reviews on Professor Nedostup's responsiveness via emails, they agreed that she was very helpful during office hours.\nCoursework consisted of weekly readings, five quizzes, one MediaKron project, and one final paper or project. Respondents found the assignments fair in difficulty level and very relevant and rewarding. However, they wished the feedback could be more timely. Students spent an average of four hours on coursework during a regular week and ten hours on busier weeks.\nReviewers suggested narrowing down the topic for a more focused lecture and directed discussion. Students recommend this course to anyone interested in history and places at China's boundaries.

There are no prerequisites for the course, but some respondents noted that writing courses or other courses in the History or East Asian Studies departments helped prepare them for this class.\nProfessor Kerry Smith received positive reviews from students as an organized, knowledgeable, and engaging lecturer on course topics. Class consisted of lectures with slideshows and weekly discussion sections. Some students did feel that Professor Smith's PowerPoint slides could have benefitted from text in addition to their images, though they also noted that his use of images, especially wartime propaganda, was very effective. Reviewers felt Professor Smith provided helpful feedback on assignments, and outside of class, students found him easily accessible.\nA writing-designated course, assignments for \"Japan's Pacific War\" consisted of weekly readings and discussion sections, two one-page papers, two 1000-1500 word papers, an in-class midterm, and a choice between a final research paper or a take-home final essay. Some students noted that readings could be unnecessarily long, offering that some weeks, only chapters or sections of books could have been assigned, rather than the books in full.\nRespondents considered the varied historical sources, especially films and propaganda, to be the most memorable part of the course. They highly recommended taking this course, stating that it will change the way students think about the Second World War.

This course has no official prerequisites, and many respondents found that no prior knowledge was required; still, many students came into the course with some familiarity with this area of history.\nProfessor Jonathan Conant taught through PowerPoint presentations, which many students found incredibly engaging. One respondent described that the instructor's \u201clecture was the academic highlight of my week.\u201d Students also found Professor Conant to be knowledgeable and always willing to provide alternate and interesting thoughts to conventional ideas.\nCoursework for HIST1205 consisted of weekly readings.

Though many students found these assessments very rewarding and interesting, many underscored that they often took a considerable amount of time to complete and that the lack of clear grading policies often made assessments difficult.\nOverall, if one is willing to put in work for this class, HIST1205 seems to be a highly enjoyable course both for the overarchingly interesting material covered and for Professor Conant\u2019s highly engaging lectures.

Professor Tim Harris and a graduate TA alternated weeks leading the discussions, which students felt they both excelled in facilitating. Reviewers appreciated that Professor Harris gave them outlines of lectures beforehand and used slides with pictures and key terms during lectures. Students also loved that Professor Harris strongly encouraged them to develop their own opinions.\nAssignments for this course included two 12\u201315-page papers, one 5-page midterm paper, two assignments outlining essays, and an average of 200 pages of weekly reading. The amount of reading was overwhelming for some students. Nonetheless, reviewers advised prospective students to read the suggested supplemental materials, as it was essential for success on the longer papers. In addition, students found the long papers to be very challenging, but the mini outlining assignments helped to prepare them.\nOverall, students found \u201cEnglish History, 1529-1660\u201d to be a demanding but very rewarding class for those interested in the subject. One respondent recommended taking a course on literature of this period such as \u201cShakespeare\u201d (ENGL0310A) to establish stronger background knowledge for this course. Reviewers noted that this course may be difficult for non-concentrators due to its long papers and significant readings.\n\ninstructor: Instructors\nTim Harris\ntimothy_harris@brown.edu\n\nschedule: Schedule and Location\nMWF 2pm-2:50pm in 111 Thayer St-Watson Institute 112\n\nprograms: Curricular Programs\nWriting - Designated Courses (WRIT)\n\naverage_hours: 6.22\n\nmax_hours: 12.89\n\ncourse_rating: 40%\n4.27\n\nprofessor_rating: 43%\n4.61\n\nprofessor_and_term: HIST 1266C | Harris, Tim (S1) | Fall 2020\n\n", "code: HIST 1266D\n\nterm: Spring 2025\n\ntitle: British History, 1660-1800\n\ndescription: \"British History, 1660-1800\" (HIST1266D) is an advanced-level WRIT history course aimed at teaching students British history through a focus on its political developments, developing ideologies, and overall themes. While the course does not require prior knowledge of British history or its specific time period, respondents suggest that a strong historical background is helpful for success in the course; one student with no prior history background stated that their decision to take the course without such a background \u201cwas not smart\u201d.\nThe course structure was two 50-minute lectures and one 50-minute small group discussion section per week. Students liked the organization of the class, which they felt helped them to learn the material and gave them time to develop their thinking and share their ideas in sections. Reviewers held Professor Tim Harris in very high regard, particularly commenting on his obvious enthusiasm for the subject which made classes lively and engaging. They also noted his extensive and helpful feedback on assignments, which they felt helped them to expand their thinking and writing.\nClass assignments for HIST1266D consisted of two short essays based on class readings, two longer (10 to 12-page) papers that called for outside reading, and a take-home midterm exam. Students strongly stressed the importance of completing the class\u2019s readings each week, which they described as lengthy, typically consisting of around 150 pages per week.\nOverall, students considered HIST1266D to be an engaging and thought-provoking class perfectly suited to History concentrators, with one reviewer stating that they would not recommend the class to non-concentrators. They stressed the interesting class material and enjoyed the myriad of opportunities the class provided for deep thinking.\n\ninstructor: Instructors\nTim Harris\ntimothy_harris@brown.edu\n\nschedule: Schedule and Location\nMWF 2pm-2:50pm Location TBD\n\nprograms: Curricular Programs\nWriting - Designated Courses (WRIT)\n\naverage_hours: 5.25\n\nmax_hours: 15.00\n\ncourse_rating: 36%\n3.90\n\nprofessor_rating: 60%\n4.54\n\nprofessor_and_term: HIST 1266D | Harris, Tim (S1) | Spring 2021\n\n", "code: HIST 1267\n\nterm: Spring 2025\n\ntitle: The Global British Empire, 1600-The Present\n\ndescription: This course charts the long history and continuing legacies of the British Empire, an entity that has transformed every single continent over the last four centuries and is widely associated with the makings of the modern world. We examine how and why a powerful and expansive British Empire emerged and sustained itself. Equally, we zoom in on the regular contestation and even outright rebellion that this transcontinental polity inspired. This course is an opportunity to think connectively and comparatively about historical experiences in America, India, the Caribbean, and Africa among multiple other British imperial spaces. We will track the making and unmaking of the British Empire by studying the evolution of global trade, labor regimes including slavery, the consumption of commodities such as sugar, as well as new ideas about governance, race, and identity.\n\ninstructor: Instructors\nTiraana Bains\ntiraana_bains@brown.edu\n\nschedule: Schedule and Location\nMWF 2pm-2:50pm Location TBD\n\ncritical_review_url: http://www.thecriticalreview.org/HIST/1267\n\n", "code: HIST 1320\n\nterm: Fall 2024\n\ntitle: Rebel Island: Cuba, 1492-Present\n\ndescription: \"Rebel Island: Cuba, 1492-Present\" (HIST1320) covers the history of Cuba from its origins as a Spanish colony to the present, emphasizing the revolutionary traditions and influences of the island. The course has no prerequisites, and students found none to be necessary, though most of them felt that other courses in history - especially Latin American history - were helpful.\nClass members emphatically endorsed Professor Jennifer Lambe as a skilled and passionate lecturer. Respondents noted that she was very clearly passionate about Cuba, and her political opinions on the subject were clear. Many cited the depth of her knowledge and her personal anecdotes about Cuba as the highlights of the course. Professor Lambe opened up class with a brief review of the last lecture's topics, before jumping into a fast-paced lecture packed with material, according to students. Reviewers enjoyed that she consistently kept lectures both highly interesting and informative, with a few saying that she is the best lecturer they have had at Brown so far. Outside of class, reviewers reported that Professor Lambe was highly available, and gave thoughtful feedback \"to ensure students improve\" throughout the semester.\nAssignments consisted of weekly readings, two reading responses, one midterm exam, and one take-home final exam (or alternatively an 8 to 10 page research paper). Respondents found readings and the midterm to be difficult at times, but always relevant and important to solidify the lessons. As far as resources go, class members generally requested more informative PowerPoints, especially for the purpose of studying for the midterm.\nStudents spent about three hours a week on average on the coursework for this class, rising to about seven hours during the busier weeks. Most of the suggestions revolved around the pace of the lectures. While reviewers overall responded very positively towards the speed of the lectures and the amount of content in each, some asked for a few of them to be slowed down slightly, or for more materials to be included on the PowerPoints. Students also asked for more sections, to offer smaller group sizes. In general, students loved this course and its instructor. For those interested in the class and looking for similar ones, they recommended other HIST courses, as well as any other courses taught by Professor Lambe.\n\ninstructor: Instructors\nJennifer Lambe\njennifer_lambe@brown.edu\n\nschedule: Schedule and Location\nTTh 10:30am-11:50am in Metcalf Research Building 107\n\nprograms: Curricular Programs\nRace, Power, and Privilege (RPP)\n\naverage_hours: 3.68\n\nmax_hours: 7.56\n\ncourse_rating: 43%\n4.66\n\nprofessor_rating: 46%\n4.88\n\nprofessor_and_term: HIST 1320 | Lambe, Jennifer (S1) | Fall 2015\n\n", "code: HIST 1340\n\nterm: Spring 2025\n\ntitle: History of the Andes from Incas to Evo Morales\n\ndescription: \u201cHistory of Brazil\u201d (HIST1340) is an upper-level course that charts the political, economic, social, intellectual, and cultural history of Brazil from Portuguese contact with the indigenous population in 1500 to the present. Students noted background and familiarity with the content, whether it was personal experiences or through other courses about Latin American history, was helpful but not necessary.\nStudents spoke highly of Professor James Green\u2019s lecturing and especially appreciated the classroom environment he cultivated. People felt that they were able to get to know each other as fellow peers, which allowed for an engaging and supportive classroom culture. Some did note that Professor Green could occasionally gloss over upcoming assignments and that more clarity and reminders could be beneficial, but this did not detract from lecturing.\nThe course consisted of weekly readings, discussion leading, one in-class final exam, and one final paper or project. Reviewers noted the course content reviewed was broad in temporal scope, which made the material rewarding to engage with.\nOverall, students immensely enjoyed and recommended the course.

The course covers questions of how and why Latin American film is used to convey historical narratives, according to its description. Topics of interest include gender and sexuality, imperialism, slavery, the church, revolution, and repression. Students agreed that there was no necessary background for the course, but experience with history, Latin American literature, and film was all helpful.\nReviewers found Professor Daniel Rodriguez to be engaging, passionate, and articulate. They found him an excellent discussion leader who asked many questions that stimulated dynamic discussion. Students also appreciated his approachability and willingness to give detailed feedback. Some noted that his lectures sometimes went off-topic, but others appreciated the casual nature of the discussions.\nThe course assignments consisted of six short response papers to weekly readings and films, a take-home midterm, and a final paper. Reviewers found the coursework to be of average difficulty and extremely relevant to the course. They found grading fair and content-focused. Some weeks had longer readings than others, but students enjoyed the material overall. One student wrote, \u201cI loved almost all the films we watched in class and they helped illuminate the readings.\u201d Reviewers generally agreed that the most memorable aspect of the course was the inclusion of a wide breadth of films.\nStudents spent an average of four to eight hours per week on HIST1381.

From nomadic Turkic warriors in Asia to multiethnic empire straddling three continents, the Ottomans became the premier power in the Mediterranean world and the last to single-handedly govern most of today\u2019s Middle East/MENA.

There are no official prerequisites, although respondents noted that having some background knowledge of Palestine and some experience writing within the context of a history course was generally helpful.\nProfessor Beshara Doumani was universally lauded by students. Not only was he described as incredibly passionate and knowledgeable about the subject material, he was also praised by respondents for facilitating a welcoming class environment for all and moderating discussions well. Some respondents noted that his sheer passion for the topic occasionally led him to be sidetracked from the listed curriculum, although it was not a major issue. Some students also hoped for slightly more guidance for the assignments and for the readings, although this did not subtract from the wonderful experience they had in class.\nCentral course assignments consisted of a midterm draft and a final paper that reviewed literature on a topic of choice. Additionally, there were some recurring assignments, including response papers and brief presentations, as well as comments on peer work. Respondents praised the biweekly response papers as helping to improve both their writing skills and their understanding of the content covered in class.\nOverall, respondents were effusive in their praise for the course. One noted that the class would \u201cchange the way you look at telling history in general\u201d, and another simply beseeched potential students not to pass this class up.

Students found it mind-opening and thought-provoking. This course goes into deep detail about aspects of American history often erased from textbooks and high school American history courses. There were no prerequisites for this course, though some students mentioned that having a background in American history could help contextualize the material.\nProfessor Naoko Shibusawa was highly regarded by her students, several of whom had taken previous courses taught by her. Most respondents found her to be effective in leading discussion and liked that she \"always connected history to current events on campus and beyond\". A few reviewers felt that some of her lectures contained too much information to absorb in one class period but that the professor's overall teaching style was nevertheless laudable. Many respondents wrote that she was readily available through email and office hours.\nStudents in this course were given the option to write either two seven-page papers or one fifteen-page final research paper. There were also weekly assignments and reading responses. Students felt that the research paper was excellent experience for anyone looking to go into academia or get their writing published. Reviewers felt that quite a lot of readings were assigned, often amounting to a book a week, but always found them fascinating. On Sunday nights, students were required to submit a reading response and discussion question. Respondents wished there were smaller assignments throughout the semester, so that their grade could be calculated from more than just the two major assignments.\nReviewers spent between four and nine hours per week on this course. Many respondents recommended this course to all students, as it is eye-opening and offers important perspectives often glossed over in the teaching of American history. Especially recommended to shoppers was Professor Shibushawa's other course, \"Empires in America from 1890,\" which is next in the sequence of American history courses.

Class members critically analyze how political, social economic, and artistic developments during this period shaped how naturalists proposed to learn about, collect, manipulate, and commercialize nature. Another theme of the course is considering the ways in which colonial projects forced Europeans to engage with other \u201cways of knowing\u201d and rethink classical knowledge systems.

The course further aims to develop the critical thinking, writing, and analytical skills of those in it. There are no official prerequisites, though respondents said that taking prior history classes, especially other upper level seminars or courses on medieval history, helped them to prepare for this course.\nClass members overwhelmingly praised Professor Remensnyder as an instructor. They regarded her to be a phenomenal discussion facilitator effective at getting students to engage in dialogue with one another. Furthermore, respondents found her to be an exceptional lecturer, though HIST1963Q focuses more on discussion than lecturing. Students found that the class environment she created was comfortable, close, and exciting. Reviewers lauded Professor Remensnyder for her compassion and care towards students, and especially noted her continued dedication to this goal amidst the pandemic\nAssignments consisted of weekly readings that were approximately 100-200 pages each, seven two-page reading responses throughout the semester, and a final project consisting of 15-20 pages. Those who took the course noted that this was a lot of reading and could be time intensive, but that the material and subsequent discussions were fascinating. One reviewer also mentioned that the professor's feedback on work was extremely helpful. Respondents spent an average of eight hours per week doing work outside of class, which jumped to 10 hours during more intense weeks.\nOverall, reviewers thoroughly enjoyed and recommended HIST1963Q to prospective students, with one suggesting that they check out another of Professor Remensnyder's courses, \"Crusaders and Cathedrals, Deviants and Dominance: Europe in the High Middle Ages\" (HIST1211) in addition to this course.\n\ninstructor: Instructors\nAmy Remensnyder\namy_remensnyder@brown.edu\n\nschedule: Schedule and Location\nTh 4pm-6:30pm in Page-Robinson Hall 503\n\nprograms: Curricular Programs\nWriting - Designated Courses (WRIT)\n\naverage_hours: 8.25\n\nmax_hours: 10.75\n\ncourse_rating: 63%\n4.75\n\nprofessor_rating: 80%\n5.00\n\nprofessor_and_term: HIST 1963Q | Remensnyder, Amy (S1) | Spring 2020\n\n", "code: HIST 1964I\n\nterm: Fall 2024\n\ntitle: England Without a Monarchy: Regicide and Republic, 1649-1660\n\ndescription: This course examines England's mid-seventeenth century revolution, looking at high and low politics, the rise of popular radicalism, and the conflict in the empire.

Many respondents reported having a previous background in reading-intensive history courses and discussion-based seminars. Others had a basic familiarity with Russian and Marxist history, which some acquired through other classes taught by Professor Pollock.\nReviewers praised Professor Pollock for effectively facilitating great discussions that, aside from Pollock\u2019s occasional insights, were primarily led by students. One respondent described Pollock as an \u201camazing discussion leader\u201d who was \u201cvery thoughtful\u201d and \u201calways incredibly prepared for class.\u201d Students also noted that Professor Pollock provided great feedback mid-semester and was available through office hours, although he was also willing to meet at other times.\nThe weekly assignments for this course include 120- to 400-page readings and a 300-word canvas discussion post. In addition, there is a 10- to 12-page research paper that serves as the final. Many respondents found the sheer length of readings to be challenging, although they generally agreed that they were relevant, worthwhile, and interesting. One reviewer also mentioned that a lot of research is expected for the final paper.\nSome students found the name of the course to be misleading. As one respondent put it, \u201c35% of the course is actually dedicated to Stalin. 65% is to establish context and read about other important actors in Stalinist Russia in the 1930s.\u201d The majority of reviewers thought that the course couldn\u2019t be improved.

Students also learn how to write research proposals and other aspects of thesis preparation. There are no official prerequisites, but at least one background class in Middle Eastern history is essential for students to get the most out of this course. This course was offered online, with synchronous Zoom meetings.\nStudents agreed that Professor Beshara Doumani was an engaging and knowledgeable instructor, praising his ability to direct and lead discussions. The class leans heavily on weekly guest lecturers, a format that students enjoyed and found very effective. Professor Doumani was said to be very receptive to students\u2019 needs and very helpful in office hours.\nThe course had weekly reading assignments and a 15-20 page final paper for which an eight-page draft was due as a midterm.

Although there are no formal prerequisites for HIST1976N, some students suggested a general history/economics background as being helpful for success in the course.\nProfessor Rieppel\u2019s seminar-based teaching style was described by the students as being \u201cvery laid-back,\u201d consisting of \u201cinformal, open discussions,\u201d with the professor stepping in \u201cto guide discussion very thoughtfully when needed.\u201d The instructor himself was praised as being \u201cengaged, knowledgeable, [and] receptive to student input,\u201d with his \u201cstrategy of guiding discussion based on questions at the beginning of class\u201d being described as \u201cvery effective.\u201d One student, however, noted that class meetings \u201cwould have benefited from short written reflections to bolster depth of discussions.\u201d Professor Rieppel was praised for being \u201cvery available\u201d outside of class and for providing \u201cdetailed, thoughtful suggestions\u201d and feedback on assignments.\nCourse assignments for HIST1976N included a term paper draft of five to seven pages, a final paper of 12-15 pages, and a one-to-two-page peer review. Respondents praised the assignments, stating that they \u201chelped to place Marx\u2019s ideas into a historical context.\u201d Reviewers generally agreed that the readings were \u201cdense,\u201d and that the assignments\u2019 difficulty depended on how much prospective students \u201cwanted to get out of the course.\u201d Regarding the papers, one student said that the written assignments were \u201cdefinitely difficult,\u201d because of the \u201cneed to do a lot of research.\u201d However, the fact that students got \u201cto choose their own research topic that they were passionate about\u201d made the papers \u201cworthwhile.\u201d\nMore than a few students described Professor Rieppel as the most memorable aspect of HIST1976N, with respondents referring to him as \u201cknowledgeable\u201d and \u201can incredible professor,\u201d and stating that \u201creading Capital with him was a privilege.\u201d Other respondents described the depth and specificity of the material as the defining characteristic of HIST1976N. The fact that the course \u201cfocused almost entirely on Capital Volume 1\u201d was evidently a source of awe to one respondent. Several students seemed to agree, with another respondent stating that the most memorable aspect of HIST1976N was the \u201cdepth of engagement with a single text.\u201d Still other respondents believed the course was characterized by \u201cinsightful class discussions,\u201d which were varyingly described as \u201clively,\u201d \u201cenjoyable,\u201d and \u201copen.\u201d Moreover, these class discussions were situated in a \u201cfriendly\u201d setting: \u201cdisagreements during discussion were constructive,\u201d according to one reviewer. One respondent went as far as to say that HIST1976N got them \u201cto think deeply about Marx both in and out of class.\u201d Reviewer suggestions regarding improvements to HIST1976N were generally concerned with course organization and efficiency. One respondent suggested a \u201cslightly better organization of class time\u201d in subsequent iterations of the course, while others called for \u201cmore programmed discussions\u201d and \u201cless time in class on presentations.\u201d One respondent suggested having \u201cstudents submit weekly responses online to engage more with reading material.\u201d Another reviewer simply suggested making sure the course \u201chappens again - it was a wild, fun time.\u201d Reviewers suggested that shoppers interested in HIST0150A take \u201cother history courses on political economy,\u201d such as \u201cHistory of Capitalism\u201d (HIST0150A). Other suggestions included taking \u201cany political theory or political philosophy seminar\u201d or \u201canything on Marx.\u201d One reviewer cautioned against understanding HIST1976N as a \u201cintroductory history class,\u201d saying that it was \u201cnice for upper level students.\u201d Another reviewer advised future students of the course to \u201cmake sure to really engage with the readings (but that doesn\u2019t mean obsess over every word and data point).\u201d\n\ninstructor: Instructors\nLukas Rieppel\nlukas_rieppel@brown.edu\n\nschedule: Schedule and Location\nW 3pm-5:30pm in Sharpe House 125\n\nprograms: Curricular Programs\nWriting - Designated Courses (WRIT)\n\naverage_hours: 5.47\n\nmax_hours: 12.40\n\ncourse_rating: 51%\n4.39\n\nprofessor_rating: 78%\n4.84\n\nprofessor_and_term: HIST 1976N | Rieppel, Lukas (S1) | Spring 2018\n\n", "code: HIST 1976U\n\nterm: Fall 2024\n\ntitle: Planning the Family\n\ndescription: HIST 1976U, \"Cannibals, Barbarians, and Noble Savages: Images of the Other in the Atlantic World\", covers European perception of the New World and its inhabitants. There are no class prerequisites, but this seminar is restricted to juniors and seniors. A background in Latin American history and/or European philosophy was found by students to be very helpful.\nProfessor Mumford was described as being both effective and professional, if a bit cold. Discussion was \"smooth\" and went well, in part due to his policy of assigning a student to lead the discussion each week. Students were told to elaborate on and defend their arguments, which made this seminar very discussion-based. He was available outside of class and his feedback was prompt, though some found it lacking in detail.\nThe work for this course consisted of one 20-page paper, one Wikipedia editing project, 100-200 pages of reading per week, and leading two in-class discussions. Students found the readings to be both relevant and interesting. Some thought that the pacing of reading per week could be improved, and that more secondary sources could be added to make the information clearer and more fascinating.\nStudents spent five to ten hours weekly on average for this course. Respondents felt that the class could use more background and guiding questions for reading discussion. A clearer and more even grading system was also suggested. This course was highly recommended to those willing to read and learn about history in a new way but another course for potential shoppers was HIST 1670, \"History of Brazil.\"\n\ninstructor: Instructors\nJennifer Johnson\njennifer_johnson1@brown.edu\n\nschedule: Schedule and Location\nF 3pm-5:30pm in Page-Robinson Hall 203\n\naverage_hours: 5.60\n\nmax_hours: 9.50\n\ncourse_rating: 45%\n3.96\n\nprofessor_rating: 49%\n4.29\n\nprofessor_and_term: HIST 1976U | Mumford, Jeremy (S1) | Spring 2012\n\n", "code: HIST 1977I\n\nterm: Spring 2025\n\ntitle: Gender, Race, and Medicine in the Americas\n\ndescription: \u201cGender, Race, and Medicine in the Americas\u201d (HIST1977I) delves into the history of medicine in the United States and Latin America, focusing on how various regional trajectories have influenced race and gender norms. Many students who took the course noted that prior experience in the history department would have provided a good foundation for primary source analysis, but they enjoyed the class nevertheless.\nRespondents described Professor Daniel Rodriguez as an excellent facilitator of discussion; they also praised him for being knowledgeable, honest, and passionate. Many students found Professor Rodriguez to be accessible through office hours, although others noted that he could be in high demand and thus limited in time. Additionally, several students expressed a desire for more feedback on the response papers, which were not handed back in class.\nAssignments for \u201cGender, Race, and Medicine in the Americas\u201d included weekly readings, six response papers, and a final paper. In preparation for final paper, students were required to turn in a proposal, introduction, outline, and a draft\u2014many students appreciated the way in which this assignment was divided into parts. Reviewers thought the readings were interesting and worthwhile, and highlighted the final paper as the most challenging part of the course due to the research and primary source analysis it entailed.\nOverall, students expressed a general enthusiasm for the material covered in the course. While nearly all respondents mentioned the quality of discussion as one of the course\u2019s positives, some suggested that a smaller class size might have further enhanced the experience.

This will lead us to interrogate what remains of the possibility of a shared breathing in the era of climate change, gas warfare, and privat(izat)ion of air: Peter Sloterdijk\u2019s notion of \u201catmoterrorism\u201d or Elias Canetti\u2019s idea of a \u201cbreath economy\u201d will be brought into conversation with M. nourbeSe Philip\u2019s writing of the \u201cga(s)p\u201d or Clarice Lispector\u2019s Breath of Life; Edgar Poe\u2019s apneic imagination in \u201cLoss of Breath\u201d will resonate against the racial politics of spirometry.

In public and closed spaces, actors leverage narratives, venues, dress, gestures, images, and soundscapes to sustain relations with others, pursue security goals, and affect the world they live in. At the intersection of the humanities and social sciences, this course foregrounds practices and designs that are constitutive of the international stage and world politics. They encompass everyday interactions as well as protocol-driven scenes, mediatized moments, and spectacular occasions. The course draws case studies from a range of historical and global contexts, from the early modern era to the present, to shed light on key forms of international society and worldmaking, from the diplomatic list to the negotiation table to the group portrait.\n\ninstructor: Instructors\nDamien Mahiet\ndamien_mahiet@brown.edu\n\nschedule: Schedule and Location\nTTh 2:30pm-3:50pm in Andrews House 006\n\nprograms: Curricular Programs\nCollaborative Scholarly Experiences (COEX)\n\ncritical_review_url: http://www.thecriticalreview.org/HMAN/1977B\n\n", "code: HMAN 2300\n\nterm: Spring 2025\n\ntitle: Introduction to Digital Humanities\n\ndescription: Digital humanities uses digital methodologies and formats to answer humanities research questions, produce and share knowledge, and teach. It encompasses critical studies of digital environments, innovative modes of researching and advancing arguments (including methodologies for constituting archives, analyzing texts and images, and visualizing data), new forms of scholarly and general publications, and digital pedagogy. The digital changes the way we research, understand, and share information in the humanities. This course will introduce students to a range of methodologies and critical lenses. Students will learn to collect resources formatted for machine-actionable research, analyze qualitative and quantitative datasets, and visualize and present their findings. They will consider the ethics of digital work and publication. Each student will plan a digital humanities project.

Facilitated by two cultural studies scholars, one located in American Studies and the other in Hispanic studies, this collaborative humanities seminar tackles the archive as an institution, a practice, and a methodology through the tools of queer studies, critical race theory, gender theory, media studies, and postcolonial studies. We will study archive theory through methodological discussions and hands-on practice with Brown\u2019s special collections at John Hay Library. We will engage the work of key scholars in the field of archival studies, such as Saidiya Hartman, Anjali Arondekar, Marisa J. Fuentes, and Zeb Tortorici.

Faces are generally considered unique to the being they belong to \u2014 usually a human being, since animals tend to be denied access to faciality. Indeed, face, understood as singularity, is for Emmanuel Levinas what grounds the ethical relation to the other. But faces, as deepfakes have shown, are also utterly replicable: they can be grafted, mimicked, appropriated, forged. Our collaborative humanities seminar will delve into the representations of faces (portraits, self-portraits, selfies, close-ups), the classification of faces (Johann Kaspar Lavater\u2019s physiognomy, the iconography of hysteria, Cesare Lombroso\u2019s Criminal Man), the staging of faces (pornography), the racial politics of faces (Blackface, facial recognition, Frantz Fanon\u2019s notion of mask), and the philosophy of \u201cfaceity\u201d (Gilles Deleuze, Jean-Luc Nancy, Giorgio Agamben).\n\ninstructor: Instructors\nPeter Szendy\npeter_szendy@brown.edu\nLaura Odello\nlaura_odello@brown.edu\n\nschedule: Schedule and Location\nT 1pm-3:30pm in Andrews House 310\n\ncritical_review_url: http://www.thecriticalreview.org/HMAN/2401Y\n\n", "code: HMAN 2402B\n\nterm: Spring 2025\n\ntitle: Empire: Global Perspectives\n\ndescription: Empires \u2014 ancient, early modern, and contemporary \u2014 have profoundly shaped the distribution of wealth and power in the modern world. However, imperial formations are strikingly diverse, and many of the entities that scholars now call \u201cempires\u201d were not understood as such during their own times. This collaborative humanities graduate seminar explores that diversity and examines how empires rise, fall, and perdure. While taking a global, comparative perspective, we also attend to local processes, analyzing how landscapes, objects, and people were bound up with imperial trajectories in such contexts as the ancient Mediterranean, Persia, China, the Andes, the Early Modern Atlantic, and the contemporary world. We afford particular attention to local peoples\u2019 relationships with empires, environmental history, political economy, historiography, and imperial art and material culture.\n\ninstructor: Instructors\nParker VanValkenburgh\nparker_vanvalkenburgh@brown.edu\nCandace Rice\ncandace_rice@brown.edu\n\nschedule: Schedule and Location\nF 9am-11:30am Location TBD\n\ncritical_review_url: http://www.thecriticalreview.org/HMAN/2402B\n\n", "code: HMAN 2402C\n\nterm: Spring 2025\n\ntitle: Reading the Large Language Models: Artificial Intelligence, Language, and Literary Art\n\ndescription: Recent advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI) have produced systems that can appear human-level in their ability to generate text and images. This technology opens questions concerning the relationships between the art and philosophy of language and computation as cultural infrastructure. This seminar will explore how technology and humans interact via language, and what it means for humans and for AI to read and to write. The format of this collaborative humanities seminar will emphasize in-class discussion. Readings will comprise a mix of literature, including digital literature, theory, and philosophy of language.

Metals are conveyors of powers, and are seated in pre-colonial mythologies, cosmologies, and ways of being in the world. In this collaborative theory/praxis course we ask with others (Walter Rodney, Eduardo Galeano, or Guam\u00e1n Poma) how these can be reclaimed through the exercise of the gestures and techniques of below-the-ground materials. What would it mean practically to overturn the histories of plunder, theft, and evacuation and imagine beyond them? A central aspect of the course is to make and visit jewelry as immanent to social and spiritual fabrics. We acknowledge the presences and excesses of the materials we work with and engage these objects beyond the colonial and monocultural imagination.\n\ninstructor: Instructors\nAriella Azoulay\nariella_azoulay@brown.edu\nMacarena Gomez-Barris\nmacarena_gomez-barris@brown.edu\n\nschedule: Schedule and Location\nM 12pm-2:30pm Location TBD\n\ncritical_review_url: http://www.thecriticalreview.org/HMAN/2402D\n\n", "code: HMAN 2500\n\nterm: Spring 2025\n\ntitle: Project Development Workshop\n\ndescription: In this capstone course, students completing the Doctoral Certificate in Collaborative Humanities pursue individual or collaborative projects, such as a dissertation chapter, an article on method/theory, or a stand-alone essay related to the larger field.

This year-long course has no prerequisites, but students who are comfortable with the Devanagari script but are lacking in conversational skills have the option to join the course in the second semester for HNDI0200. Students also noted that any prior knowledge of Hindi, even just a few phrases or basic grammar, was helpful but by no means necessary for success in the course.\nProfessor Ashok Koul was praised by reviewers for his patience and the engaging nature of his lessons. Professor Koul dedicated time each week to in-class discussion, which reviewers overwhelmingly agreed was helpful for developing conversational skills in Hindi. Some students felt that more small group or individual work would have been beneficial, noting that it was harder to understand the work done as a full class because some students had more background in the language than others. Students appreciated that Professor Koul was more than willing to explain concepts multiple times when there was confusion and added that his passion about the subject made classes even more enjoyable.\nAssignments for HNDI0200 included daily written homeworks, which were graded for completion, four quizzes, three written exams, a final oral presentation, and a group video project. Students found the workload to be manageable, spending an average of five hours per week on assignments outside of class, though this number rose as high as 11 hours per week when preparing for exams. Some assignments included news, cartoons, and other media in Hindi to reinforce usage of the language.\nStudents in HNDI0200 found the course to be a great introduction to Hindi and were pleasantly surprised by how confident they were in their language skills and their ability to apply these abilities outside of the classroom, adding that even students who have difficulty learning languages could enjoy this course. For students taking this class in the future, reviewers emphasized that staying on top of assignments and putting in the time to study vocabulary made the class much easier. Reviewers wholeheartedly recommended HNDI0200 to anyone interested in the subject, citing the class discussions and Professor Koul\u2019s enthusiasm as highlights of the course.\n\ninstructor: Instructors\nAshok Koul\nashok_koul@brown.edu\n\nschedule: Schedule and Location\nMTWThF 12pm-12:50pm Location TBD\n\nprograms: Curricular Programs\nSecond Half of Year Course (YC02)\n\naverage_hours: 4.40\n\nmax_hours: 7.20\n\ncourse_rating: 43%\n4.55\n\nprofessor_rating: 66%\n4.93\n\nprofessor_and_term: HNDI 0200 | Koul, Ashok (S1) | Spring 2020\n\n", "code: HNDI 0300\n\nterm: Fall 2024\n\ntitle: Intermediate Hindi-Urdu\n\ndescription: \u201cIntermediate Hindi-Urdu\u201d (HNDI0300) is the first part of a year-long intermediate Hindi/Urdu course intended to improve students' proficiency in speaking, listening, reading, and writing in Hindi and Urdu for personal and professional needs. This course is also designed for students to learn about South Asian culture while learning the language. The prerequisite course is \u201cBeginning Hindi or Urdu\u201d (HNDI0200), and it was noted that speaking another Indo-Aryan language facilitated comprehension of these languages.\nProfessor Ashok Koul was commended on his enthusiastic, engaging, and efficient teaching style. He was passionate, friendly, and very accommodating to student needs and what they sought from the class, with one student remarking \u201cI've learned a lot from him just from casual conversation.\u201d Respondents found that Dr. Koul was always available for help, and both native Hindi and English speakers found his instruction in Urdu effective.\nThe coursework consisted of daily homework assignments, three written exams, one take-home exam, one oral exam, and one final project consisting of written and oral components. Students remarked that they enjoyed the read-alouds required in class. Participation also comprised a fifth of the course grade, for which some reviewers emphasized being prepared to speak in class, and also make mistakes. Some recommended that the homework should have had more focus on grammar. One student also sought more graded assignments and quizzes to keep students accountable for the material, as it was easy to forget some material due to a lack of regular practice assignments. Feedback on assignments was returned promptly and fairly.\nHNDI0300 was highly recommended as a means to maintain conversational and cultural fluency for Hindi and Urdu, for both those concentrating and not concentrating in South Asian Studies. To those who are considering this course, even native speakers, students emphasized the importance of keeping up with the vocabulary and reviewing grammar.

HNDI0300 is an official prerequisite for this class, and former students fittingly reported that HNDI0100-0300 prepared them for HNDI0400.\nRespondents agreed that Professor Ashok Koul cared about the students, was \u201cextremely passionate,\" and was receptive to students\u2019 concerns. Professor Koul led class by \u201cfostering classroom collective discussion about historical and cultural topics.\" Students had the opportunity to read aloud from in-class packets to their peers, which helped improve reading comprehension. Students also appreciated being engaged in conversation with Professor Koul about topics like the news as it gave students the chance to regularly practice conversation. In addition to discussions and in-class packets, Professor Koul also used lectures and made himself available to class members who wanted to spend time learning outside of class. Ultimately, respondents believe that the professor created a \u201clow key\u201d and fun environment to learn in, and the presentation of the material was effective for the students\u2019 learning.\nAssignments included in-class readings, written summaries reflecting on class discussion, weekly readings and online materials (Hindi news, TV shows, movies, and songs), weekly vocabulary quizzes, three exams (including both written and oral portions), one oral exam, and a group skit project. Most respondents reported spending an average of five hours per week outside of class on the material.\nOverall, class members had a positive experience taking HNDI0400 with Professor Koul.

The only official prerequisite for this class is \u201cPrinciples of Economics\u201d (ECON0110) or an equivalent test score, but students noted that additional coursework in Economics, Political Science, and/or IAPA could be useful.\nProfessor Veronica Ingham was described by reviewers as extremely passionate about the material. They also said that she presented information effectively, was receptive to student needs, and gave useful feedback on assignments. At times, respondents felt that the professor did not facilitate a lot of discussions, which they would have preferred because the class had a small number of students. However, on the whole, students found Professor Ingham to be a very kind professor who was invested in their success.\nCourse requirements in IAPA1401 included readings and pre-recorded lectures, along with homework assignments based on those materials to complete before every class. Students were responsible for leading class discussions during a few classes at the end of the semester, for which they were required to write response papers in preparation. Tests included an in-class midterm and a final. Respondents said that the workload for this class could be heavy but seemed reasonable and that all of the readings were worthwhile. The average amount of time a student typically spent on work for this class was around four and a half hours per week.\nOverall, students found \u201cEconomic Development in Latin America\u201d to be a meaningful class that challenged them to grow and taught them a lot. They stressed that Professor Ingham wanted students to learn. Many noted that this class is ideal for students who are interested in economics, international affairs, public policy, and/or political science, with one such reviewer calling this class \u201cthe best class I\u2019ve taken at Brown!\u201d Apart from that, they also generally recommended this class to non-IAPA concentrators.\n\ninstructor: Instructors\nVeronica Ingham\nveronica_ingham@brown.edu\n\nschedule: Schedule and Location\nTTh 9am-10:20am in 67 George Street 104\n\naverage_hours: 4.63\n\nmax_hours: 8.14\n\ncourse_rating: 41%\n4.33\n\nprofessor_rating: 62%\n4.65\n\nprofessor_and_term: IAPA 1401 | Ingham, Veronica (S1) | Fall 2021\n\n", "code: IAPA 1402\n\nterm: Spring 2025\n\ntitle: Beyond Sun, Sea and Sand: Exploring the Contemporary Caribbean\n\ndescription: \u201cBeyond Sun, Sea and Sand: Exploring the Contemporary Caribbean\u201d (IAPA1402) is a seminar class designed to rework conceptions of the Caribbean that have been popularized within the tourism industry by exploring literature, film, and traditions. The course approaches the region through themes such as politics, class, migration, and ethnicity, among others. Students did not feel any background knowledge was required and there are no official prerequisites. The course is WRIT and DIAP-designated.\nProfessor Patsy Lewis was lauded as an effective discussion facilitator by class members. She was also noted to have \u201cgreat insights,\u201d with students calling her contributions their \u201cfavorite part of the class.\u201d Being from Grenada, Professor Lewis was said to be knowledgeable on the matters discussed, especially in relation to the English-speaking Caribbean. The entire course was discussion-based, with both student-led and professor-led classes. Thus, respondents recommended that students stay on top of readings in order to fully participate.\nThe weekly assignments for the course consisted of roughly 80 pages of reading to prepare for each class, equating to an average of three hours outside of class each week. Respondents emphasized the importance of doing the readings for success in the course. Besides the in-class discussion, there were two papers and a final group project.\nEnjoyed by concentrators and non-concentrators alike, this course was recommended for students who are interested in a broad overview of the Caribbean via hands-on discussion led by both students and the insightful Professor Lewis.\n\ninstructor: Instructors\nPatsy Lewis\npatsy_lewis@brown.edu\n\nschedule: Schedule and Location\nTh 4pm-6:30pm Location TBD\n\nprograms: Curricular Programs\nRace, Power, and Privilege (RPP)\nWriting - Designated Courses (WRIT)\n\naverage_hours: 3.00\n\nmax_hours: 6.00\n\ncourse_rating: 38%\n4.08\n\nprofessor_rating: 59%\n4.39\n\nprofessor_and_term: IAPA 1402 | Lewis, Patsy (S1) | Spring 2022\n\n", "code: IAPA 1500A\n\nterm: Fall 2024\n\ntitle: Ethnographic Research Methods\n\ndescription: This course introduces students to ethnographic research methods as a capacious set of tools for understanding the diverse ways people make sense of social issues that affect their lives and shape their experiences. It also addresses the ethical, legal, and political dilemmas that ethnographers encounter while engaging in field research. The course consists of weekly lectures, fieldwork practice, and ethnographic lab sessions. Students learn how ethnographers design their research projects, undertake participant observation in their chosen field sites (including online), write fieldnotes, prepare for and conduct interviews, collect and analyze artifacts, use visual and audio tools to experiment with multimodality, and work with archives, both historic and contemporary. Throughout the course, students will practice and apply these methods to pursue independent research projects on a topic of their choice.

While the practice of diplomacy and the policy-making process has a U.S. focus, the lessons learned apply to other nation states as well. We briefly review the history of inter-state relations, including the international legal basis for diplomatic relations. Diplomacy has evolved over the years and has been greatly influenced by modern technology; however, it continues to incorporate such common functions as policy formulation, representation, reporting, negotiation, intercultural contacts and interaction with the media, parliamentary bodies and other external actors.

Our focus is on the American expression of these issues and debates. But we will look to the experience of other multilevel democracies to highlight conceptual and institutional differences that are of theoretical interest and perhaps of practical use. In particular, the seminar will explore how the goals of education as a public good get defined; the history of school finance and governance in America; the ways in which \u2018school choice\u2019 has intersected in practice and in theory with segregation, integration, and debates over mechanisms to improve school quality; on the problems of test-based accountability regimes; and on the role teacher training systems in educational improvement.\n\ninstructor: Instructors\nAnthony Levitas\nanthony_levitas@brown.edu\n\nschedule: Schedule and Location\nW 3pm-5:30pm in 111 Thayer St-Watson Institute 114\n\nprograms: Curricular Programs\nWriting - Designated Courses (WRIT)\n\ncritical_review_url: http://www.thecriticalreview.org/IAPA/1701X\n\n", "code: IAPA 1702A\n\nterm: Spring 2025\n\ntitle: Diplomacy and Development: Related but Different Missions\n\ndescription: This course will explore two international relations missions\u2014diplomacy and development cooperation-- that complement one another but differ in substance and nature. Diplomacy, comprised of statecraft, policy formulation, representation, reporting and negotiation, will be treated in opening segments. The diplomatic mission is about influencing other sovereign states to bridge national differences in an effort to promote interests and avoid conflict.

Historically, one reason Americans have been thought to tolerate inequality is that we tend to believe that our society is a mobile one, where people can easily move from one social class to another. But in recent years, inequality and stagnant social mobility have been associated with increasing social and political distrust and unrest. In this junior seminar, we will examine the economic and political, and ideological factors that have contributed to this historical moment, learn about how Americans experience living in an unequal society, and consider the future of equality and social mobility in the United States.

This class explores technological innovation to better understand the changing dynamics of the global political economy and relations between the market and the state. It focuses on the concept of smart production as an outgrowth of flexible production, which is changing relationships between the human body and machine, collective and individual data extraction, and their social adaptations. Through an analysis of these transformations, the class will examine how our ideas of scale, especially the concept of \u201clocal\u201d, and the meaning of value are being reimagined, and what effect this has on interactions between state, society and market.\n\ninstructor: Instructors\nNa Fu\nna_fu@brown.edu\n\nschedule: Schedule and Location\nM 3pm-5:30pm in 111 Thayer St-Watson Institute 138\n\nprograms: Curricular Programs\nWriting - Designated Courses (WRIT)\n\ncritical_review_url: http://www.thecriticalreview.org/IAPA/1702E\n\n", "code: IAPA 1702F\n\nterm: Fall 2024\n\ntitle: Political (dis)engagement, (de)mobilization, and dissent in Eastern Europe\n\ndescription: The course will explore the forms and dynamics of popular political participation, engagement, and disengagement, as they have been emerging and evolving in the region of Eastern Europe, which has been defined by popular mobilizations and revolutions as well as authoritarianism, imperialism, and large-scale war. We will analyze the variations, divergences, and commonalities between the social and political contexts of different states with a special focus on Russia, Ukraine, and Belarus, whose relations are characterized by intertwined histories, power asymmetries, close connections, and extreme confrontations. By situating the developments in this region within broader global and historical contexts, participants will reflect on the possibilities and dynamics of political and societal change and its trajectories.

This course will draw primarily on sociological literature and methods to explore theories and case studies of governance at the margins, highlighting the role of state institutions from courts and prisons to hospitals and schools. The course material will focus on the governance of low-income Black and Brown families in the United States, though much of what we study will apply to other marginalized groups and contexts as well.

Do state-initiated marketization and globalization create discontinuities in socialist governance? Should one understand Beijing\u2019s reinforcement of state sovereignty in the contemporary era as a simple revival of an authoritarian regime, or as more innovative practices? In what ways are governing practices under the Chinese socialist system similar to, or different from, those under liberal democracies?

This course will cover a diverse range of topics including the history, structure, and financing of humanitarian response; the public health evidence base for common human security interventions; and the intersections between human rights and humanitarianism.\n\ninstructor: Instructors\nAdam Levine\nadam_levine@brown.edu\n\nschedule: Schedule and Location\nW 3pm-5:30pm in Page-Robinson Hall 403\n\nprograms: Curricular Programs\nWriting - Designated Courses (WRIT)\n\ncritical_review_url: http://www.thecriticalreview.org/IAPA/1802S\n\n", "code: IAPA 1803\n\nterm: Fall 2024\n\ntitle: Humanitarian Response in Modern Conflict\n\ndescription: As armed conflicts massively affect humanitarian populations, how do different groups (policymakers, humanitarian groups, or armed forces) deal with the challenges of addressing such crises? \"Humanitarian Response in Modern Conflict\" (IAPA1803) explores this question along with several other topics related to this question. As an upper-level seminar, IAPA1803 was limited to students of specific semesters and accessible to register only through a Google Form; that being said, no strict background was necessary to enroll in this course. Many students, in addition, agreed that no formal knowledge was required; however, an active interest in solving world issues and brainstorming ideas were beneficial.\nProfessor David Polatty taught IAPA1803. Students overwhelmingly praised Professor Polatty for his passion for the material, his care for the class, and his care for his students. Many reviewers underscored how thoroughly and clearly he answered questions and how engaging he made the class. His feedback and advice on student papers were extremely helpful, detailed, and targeted; as one student described, \"his feedback on papers throughout shows that he really took the time to edit them to make his students better writers.\" Moreover, Professor Polatty was described as more than willing to help students succeed outside of class, with one student writing that he often helped students connect with professional opportunities and research projects related to the class topics.\nCourse assignments consisted of weekly readings, discussion posts, humanitarian response simulations, and a midterm and final paper. Many students found these weekly readings incredibly interesting and approachable, providing a \"comprehensive yet immensely digestible view of the humanitarian landscape.\" Much of the simulations, moreover, helped to apply the principles taught in class or readings.\nOverall, reviewers greatly. praised \"Humanitarian Response in Modern Conflict,\" both for its intriguing and relevant content and for Professor Polatty. Reviewers emphasized that potential shoppers shouldn't consider this course as only for IAPA concentrators, but for anyone that is curious about real-world issues and humanitarian work. As one student simply writes, \"Professor Polatty's synthesis of humanitarian issues is the most effective of any similar course that I've taken.\"\n\ninstructor: Instructors\nDavid Polatty\ndavid_polatty@brown.edu\n\nschedule: Schedule and Location\nM 3pm-5:30pm in Metcalf Research Building 107\n\nprograms: Curricular Programs\nWriting - Designated Courses (WRIT)\n\naverage_hours: 3.43\n\nmax_hours: 7.71\n\ncourse_rating: 60%\n4.50\n\nprofessor_rating: 88%\n4.96\n\nprofessor_and_term: IAPA 1803 | Polatty, David (S1) | Fall 2022\n\n", "code: IAPA 1804\n\nterm: Fall 2024\n\ntitle: Diplomacy, Crisis, and War in the Modern Era\n\ndescription: This undergraduate seminar examines war and peace after 1945 through the lens of international relations (IR) theory.

The class focuses mainly on Supreme Court cases. The first three weeks of the course are focused on a basic overview of civil procedure, culminating in a capstone public policy paper on a timely or complex legal issue of the student\u2019s choice. The class combines traditional lecturing with interactive mock trials. Enrollment is limited to students with a semester level of 07, 08, 09, 10, 11, 12, or 13, and although there are no prerequisites, an instructor override code is required. Students found that a background or interest in the law and mock trials proved helpful.\nRespondents described Professor Ari Gabinet as a very intelligent and engaging professor. They appreciated the plethora of materials he provided and that he employed debate and oral argument practice. Respondents did note that he used cold-calling in class, which at first proved nerve-racking, though students grew to appreciate it, as it resembles many law school classes. Some also thought the class moved quickly, but explained that Professor Gabinet was still attentive to students\u2019 needs.\nThe assignments for the course consisted of weekly readings of assigned cases, weekly papers, mock court arguments in class, and a final capstone paper, as described above. Respondents emphasized the importance of preparing for each class, as the course requires student participation, whether through cold-calling or arguing during the mock trials.\nStudents described the class as \u201cchallenging but worth it.\u201d Respondents greatly appreciated Professor Gabinet\u2019s knowledge on the subject, and many greatly enjoyed the class's debate/oral argument aspect as it made for a lively and engaging class environment.\n\ninstructor: Instructors\nAri Gabinet\narthur_gabinet@brown.edu\n\nschedule: Schedule and Location\nT 4pm-6:30pm in 111 Thayer St-Watson Institute 116\n\nprograms: Curricular Programs\nWriting - Designated Courses (WRIT)\n\naverage_hours: 8.00\n\nmax_hours: 21.00\n\ncourse_rating: 44%\n4.65\n\nprofessor_rating: 67%\n5.00\n\nprofessor_and_term: IAPA 1804D | Gabinet, Ari (S1) | Fall 2022\n\n", "code: IAPA 1804M\n\nterm: Spring 2025\n\ntitle: Overcoming Threats to Human Security\n\ndescription: \u201cOvercoming Threats to Human Security\u201d (IAPA1804M) is a seminar-style course that provides a comprehensive introduction to exploring humanitarian challenges and responses to events such as climate change, natural disasters, and pandemics. Enrollment is through application only with priority given to senior IAPA concentrators, but others are welcome to apply. While there are no official prerequisites to the class, several respondents found a background in international politics and human rights to be beneficial.\nProfessor David Polatty was praised for his kindness, flexibility, and passion for the subject. Class meetings centered on student discussions and interactive exercises, including a few simulations of humanitarian crises. Students were responsible for reviewing materials prior to the class meeting and bringing in questions and discussion topics for the group. Respondents described the welcoming classroom environment created by Professor Polatty and emphasized that they were encouraged to come to office hours as often as they\u2019d like. Professor Polatty\u2019s course was even described by one reviewer as \u201cTruly one of the highlights of my academic experience at Brown!\u201d\nAssignments for IAPA1804M included weekly readings between 100 and 120 pages, a five to six-page midterm paper, and a ten-page final paper expanding on their previous work.

These activities enabled students to experience crises through the perspective of military decision-makers and were lauded by respondents as eye-opening and engaging. Students generally felt that all class assignments contributed to their learning in a meaningful way.\nThis course was highly praised by all reviewers, with most describing it as a meaningful course without too much stress.

The course is designed to familiarize students with the Italian language and culture. Most students taking ITAL0100 either have no previous experience in Italian or have a background in Spanish.\nStudents unanimously praised Professor Cristina Abbona-Sneider (known affectionately by her students as Christina) for her effective teaching style, engaging seminars, and approachability outside of class. Students noted that Christina never spoke English and the class was entirely taught in Italian. She was praised by her students for being able to help them learn the Italian language very quickly. Christina was readily available outside of class via email and during office hours. One reviewer even went as far as to declare that she is a \u201cclear, enthusiastic, passionate, organized, warm, and lovely person.\u201d\nCoursework included Connect homework assignments, seven online quizzes, six compositions, one pair/group presentation, and three exams. Students found some homework assignments were generally not too difficult and highly relevant to learning the language. Students also said Christina always gave good feedback for writing assignments.\nOverall, students enjoyed the course because it allowed them to gain fluency in Italian. Students felt that Christina did a great job of creating an immersive environment augmented by interesting learning materials and a small class size.

The only prerequisite for this course is having taken the first half of the sequence.\nReviewers loved Professor Cristina Abbona-Sneider and her teaching style. The majority of grammar work was done independently from the textbook\u2019s online homework activities, and in-class time was used to reinforce grammar, vocabulary, and genuine communication skills. Professor Abbona-Sneider used a variety of activities to keep students practicing and on the same page in their vocabulary and grammar acquisition. Class was reported to be enjoyable; one reviewer wrote that not a day went by without laughter. Professor Abbona-Sneider also gave kind and personal feedback on all written and oral assignments and was easy to reach in her office hours or via email. She was reported to be very invested in helping her students succeed.\nITAL0200 had online homework assignments, weekly quizzes, a weekly short composition, three exams, a presentation, and a final project. Respondents had varied opinions about the assignments\u2019 difficulty. A few reviewers felt that they were not overwhelmingly difficult, and one person wrote that the homework was fairly difficult, but helpful because it forced them to make improvements. Besides these comments, one reviewer also pointed out that because there are so many smaller assignments, there was less reason to stress over grades on each one.\nThis is a great introductory language class for anyone wanting to learn Italian. It was effective, fun (several students noted Italian sing-alongs as being a highlight), and low-stress for the amount they got out of it. Reviewers\u2019 one wish was that the online exercises be shortened, as they could be time-consuming.

It also serves as an introduction to modern Italian culture and society to enforce students' understanding of global themes including immigration, stereotypes, politics, family and gender, and food. Although this course does not cover basic grammar taught in previous Italian language courses, constructing and editing essays are meant to aid students in refining their writing. Required prerequisites include ITAL0400 or a sufficient knowledge of the language.\nReviewers recounted Professor Abbona-Sneider as \"warm, welcoming, and encouraging of everyone's participation\" and even \"the best professor at Brown\". She was described as passionate about the material and approachable to class members for questions or additional advice.\nCourse requirements involved daily readings, assigned films to be watched asynchronously prior to each class, multiple responses every week, four papers excluding the final, and one group presentation. Students noted that Professor Abbona-Sneider fostered a comfortable learning environment that helped develop their confidence in speaking Italian and that the assignments were relevant and helpful. On average, reviewers spent four to five hours outside of class weekly on the material with a maximum of 11 hours.\nAll in all, students thoroughly enjoyed this class, particularly emphasizing the modern Italian culture component in contrast to previous Italian courses.

This course not only offers practice in the domains of speaking and writing, but also introduces Italian history and modern Italian culture in order to prepare students to take more specialized courses in the department.\nThis class included elements of both lecture and discussion (according to one reviewer, in a perfect balance). Professor Cristina Abbona-Sneider presented material with the help of pleasant-looking slides and various media, such as music and poetry, when applicable.

From literature to film/tv series, from photography to visual art to poetry, artists have politically engaged, challenged and modified the idea of resistance embedded within the identity of contemporary Italians. We look at artistic expressions of resistance performed against different forms of power (nationalism, the colonial state, the patriarchal family, the Mafia, the Church, police violence).

Students came away with a deeper understanding of the complexities of the text and medieval literature. It is given in English, designed for students with no knowledge of Italian, but some respondents reported that previous experiences of taking classes in literature or poetry may be helpful. Students benefitted tremendously from having a general knowledge of medieval Europe/Italy, the Catholic Church, and other classics.\nProfessor Ronald Martinez was praised by many respondents as having a \u201cfun background and expertise\u201d. Students found the sheer amount of information Professor Martinez knew about Dante extremely helpful. One respondent remarked that \u201cany question you could think of, he had an answer for.\u201d During the class, Professor Martinez gave rich lectures packed with information about the material and focused on what he considered important as well as what students voiced their interest in. He was also very willing to take questions and engage with student perspectives on the material. However, one reviewer found Professor Martinez\u2019s written instructions on assignments vague and confusing, which did not steer them in the right direction; and asked to elaborate, his elaborations helped very little.\nAs the course title suggests, students are expected to read Dante in English translation. Coursework included 300-450 lines of poetry reading per class, short discussion posts on Canvas (approximately once per class), one midterm quiz (not graded, used to help professor gauge how much information students had retained), one five-page paper, one ten-page paper, and one 15-page paper. Reviewers reported that reading for this course was light and provided insight into the politics, theology, history, and society of both the time period (the late 1200s to early 1300s) and Dante Alighieri himself.\nOverall, the majority of viewers spoke highly of this course and the instructor\u2019s expertise in the subject.

It helps students to strengthen their analytical skills and communication ability in Italian, as well as introducing students to classical Italian text. Required background for the course was Italian language skill at the 600 level. Students additionally felt that some experience with Greek myth, the Bible, Ovid\u2019s \u201cMetamorphosis,\u201d and Italian medieval history and culture was helpful.\nRespondents described Professor Martinez as enthusiastic and full of knowledge, which he skillfully applied to the enjoyably rambling seminars that typified the course. Respondents did mention that the professor was sometimes a little scattered. Questions and participation were greatly encouraged, and students felt that, in a class of seven people, there were plenty of opportunities for all students to participate.\nStudents found the main Dante texts most useful of the course\u2019s assigned reading, mentioning that the footnotes were particularly useful. The supplementary texts, including the handouts, were less enjoyed. The work for this course included one paper of three to four pages, one paper of five to six pages, and a final paper of eight to ten pages. Additionally, students were graded heavily on participation.

It aims to cover a wide range of fundamental but comprehensive grammar and vocabulary that are essential for future study in Japanese. Nearly half of the reviewers mentioned that they had no background in Japanese or other East Asian languages, but almost all of them agreed that having a strong, committed interest to the Japanese language was key to their success in the course.\nThe course was co-taught by four instructors: Professor Hiroshi Tajima, Professor Yoko Jackson, Professor Sachiko Hiramatsu, and Professor Nahoko Collis. The lecture was guided by PowerPoint presentations of new grammar structures and vocabulary, which was then followed by group/pair practices. Students universally praised all the professors for being very passionate, caring, and engaging. Many reviewers also appreciated the sense of community in the small class and the numerous bonding activities outside the classroom, such as Language Table and onigiri-making. Most students noted that all the instructors were very available after class and would actively reach out to everyone who was struggling and falling behind. Reviewers especially appreciated the many office hours and timely feedback from the instructors.\nAssignments consisted of daily homework, two writing projects, and one final presentation. In addition, there were weekly quizzes and chapter exams for grammar and vocabulary. Most reviewers thought that the assignments were straightforward and relevant to the course material. However, they cautioned that the preparation for the quizzes and exams could be highly time-consuming, but many agreed that they were good practice and helped them enormously in learning the language.\nAll in all, nearly all the students enjoyed this course and thought the instructors were the most memorable part. However, a few students also noted that the slight inconsistencies in the lecture styles of the different instructors sometimes made the classroom activities confusing and overwhelming. As for future improvement, many reviewers suggested having more conversation practices with TAs and uploading slides onto Canvas in a more timely fashion.\n\ninstructor: Instructors\nNaemi McPherson\nnaemi_mcpherson@brown.edu\nSueyon Seo\nsueyon_seo@brown.edu\nAtsuko Borgmann\natsuko_borgmann@brown.edu\nAya Yamakawa\naya_yamakawa@brown.edu\nKumiko Akama\nkumiko_akama@brown.edu\n\nschedule: Schedule and Location\nMWF 9am-9:50am in 111 Thayer St-Watson Institute 114\nTTh 9am-10:20am in 111 Thayer St-Watson Institute 114\n\nprograms: Curricular Programs\nFirst Half of Year Course (YC01)\n\naverage_hours: 5.85\n\nmax_hours: 9.25\n\ncourse_rating: 42%\n4.47\n\nprofessor_rating: 62%\n4.64\n\nprofessor_and_term: JAPN 0100 | Tajima, Hiroshi (S3) | Fall 2018\n\n", "code: JAPN 0200\n\nterm: Spring 2025\n\ntitle: Basic Japanese\n\ndescription: \"Basic Japanese\" (JAPN0200) is the second half of a year-long course that aims to give students a foundation in Japanese. The first half (JAPN0100) is the prerequisite, but a minimum score of WAIVE in \u2018Graduate Student PreReq\u2019 serves as an adequate substitute.\nThe class was taught by four instructors. Professor Hiroshi Tajima was described as hilarious, enthusiastic, and informative. According to reviewers, Tajima-sensei was effective at making sure every student participated in class and spoke \u201cnatural\u201d Japanese. Professor Nahoko Collis was characterized as fun, energetic, challenging, encouraging, and \u201cthe sweetest.\u201d Professor Sachiko Hiramatsu was described as a challenging teacher but clear lecturer who was effective at reviewing material. Finally, Professor Yuko Jackson was considered to be a very patient teacher who was \u201camazing\u201d at explaining grammar. Overall, respondents thought the professors were wonderful and passionate teachers, but that they could have benefited from more coordination. According to one student, some material wasn\u2019t covered because none of the instructors realized that the information wasn\u2019t taught by the other three. However, many were pleased with the instructors\u2019 availability through office hours and rapid response to emails. Although days leading up to tests and projects could be busy, TAs were also at hand.\nThe assignments for one semester of the full-year course included daily homework from the textbook, one or two quizzes per week, six- or seven-chapter comprehension tests, two or three group writing projects, and a final oral presentation. Although the sheer number of assignments made the class time-consuming, students generally agreed that the work was very helpful and relevant to the course.\nRespondents thought that the class could be improved through more professor coordination, teaching more consistently with information on the PowerPoint slides, uploading slideshows and grades to Canvas, slowing down the pace of the course, and spending more class time on grammar.

Although \u201cBasic Japanese\u201d (JAPN0200) is listed as a formal prerequisite, it is possible to enter the class with an introductory background in Japanese language without having taken the prerequisite.\nThe instructors, Professors Naemi McPherson and Kikuko Namashita, were described as being clear and straightforward in their teaching style. The class was designed to start with a lecture, followed by a class discussion. Reviewers agreed that the professors were accommodating of varying levels of experience and comfort with the language and were receptive to questions. Respondents wished they could receive more detailed feedback on assignments, but stated that they could attend office hours to get it if they desired.\nAssignments for the class consisted of several readings, reading responses on Canvas, daily homework, quizzes, and projects. As the class met every day and had frequent assignments, reviewers noted that it was important to stay on top of deadlines to ensure nothing was missed. Reading assignments were centered around Japanese culture in order to help students improve their grammar, vocabulary, and reading comprehension. Most students found the readings to be useful and worthwhile to learning the material, but not overly difficult.\nOverall, students found JAPN0300 to be an engaging and educational course.

Reviewers also noted that the lectures were well-paced with great slides. Students found the teaching style, which consisted of dialogue practice, discussions between students, and random selections of students for reading discussions, to be effective and humorous. Respondents noted that both professors were available after class, provided good feedback, and were willing to help.\nThe course assignments consisted of daily readings and homework, four projects (five minute presentations and essay drafts), quizzes (approximately every two weeks), unit tests (approximately every week), and exams.

Students also identified the instructors' guidelines and the textbook as very helpful in completing the homework assignments.\nOverall, students found the professors and their humor to be the most memorable parts of the course. Some students wished for the instructors to utilize Canvas so that they could keep track of their grades. Students also wanted the instructors to upload the schedule beforehand alongside class files, so that students could prepare for class beforehand.

We will study selections of fiction and memoirs by writers of Christian and Jewish background that explore such situations as the affirmation or negation of the existence of God, the role of religious ritual in a person\u2019s life, and the positive and negative impacts on society of religious institutions and the clergy who lead them.

Mutual admiration, influence, and hatred have combined together in a difficult relationship, fundamental to European history. In this course, we will survey that relationship, examining some key issues and events which shaped it. The Jews' attitudes and actions will be examined alongside those of their Christian neighbors.

Our aim is to reframe this crucial question by reflecting on the categories of religion, conversion, origins, narrative, and history, among others.

The class begins by teaching the Korean writing system, Hangul. Modern Korean then is taught through a combination of reading, writing, listening, and speaking. The class meets for one hour every day. Because of the yearlong nature of the course, the student receives one grade at the end of a full year. No background is required and students did not find any necessary.\nReviewers found that Visiting Lecturer Hyun Ju Ha taught the course in an extremely clear and effective manner. Students wrote that she was extremely knowledgeable about both Korean and English, as well as about the objectives of the class. The professor was engaged in student learning, making sure to answer any questions, particularly those that arose with new material. The class used a combination of handouts, PowerPoint presentations, and lectures. Professor Ha held weekly office hours and was available by appointment and email. Students found Professor Ha extremely accessible, calling her a kind and funny professor.\nAssignments consisted of weekly homework, eight vocabulary quizzes (each covering a chapter), four exams (each covering two chapters), an oral interview, a final, and two major presentations. The homework mainly came from the workbook, consisting of written, listening, and speaking portions. One presentation was in English on Korean culture. The other presentation was in Korean on campus life. Participation in class was mandatory and solely in Korean. Students found this extremely helpful in solidifying ideas. Assignments and exams were fair and based on class material.\nStudents really enjoyed the small, interactive nature of the class, which let them really get to know each other.

Professor Lee-Smith received excellent reviews. She was \u201cwitty, organized, willing, ambitious, very driven and motivated.\u201d Lee-Smith was very enthusiastic but sometimes moved a little fast. Her use of visual and oral methods of learning made her lessons quite successful and interesting and made Korean enjoyable. She was friendly and gave great individual attention.

Nevertheless, students were impressed by her effort to help them outside of class.\nThe coursework consisted of five exams, one presentation and daily homework assignments. There was an exam or quiz about every two weeks. There was also one oral exam. Some complained that the homework should have had more focus on grammar.\nMost students spent about five hours per week on this course \u2013 which met their expectations. One student only spent two \u2013 but wouldn\u2019t have minded spending more.

However, Professor Michelle Quay\u2019s class \u201cProtest and Dissidence in Iran\u201d (LANG0710) explores these very nuances through a broad selection of texts, film and art. This course examines events such as the 1979 Iranian Revolution and how they still affect Iran\u2019s relationship to the West, as well as modern Iranian culture, art, government, and media. The class also examines themes such as corruption, authoritarianism, multiculturalism, race, and gender relations in today\u2019s Iranian culture and society. Although this writ-designated first year seminar has no prerequisites, several previous students noted that having knowledge of Iranian history and an interest in global affairs or Iranian politics and culture was helpful.\nStudents of \u201cProtest and Dissidence in Iran\u201d greatly enjoyed Professor Quay\u2019s style of teaching, which involved a mixture of short lectures, small group discussion, and whole class discussion. Additionally, students praised Professor Quay as incredibly nice, knowledgeable, and receptive to student needs. One student in particular described Professor Quay as amazing, and greatly appreciated her willingness to answer any and all student questions, even if they were not directly related to the topic at hand.\nThe workload for the course consisted of weekly readings/movies, weekly canvas responses, two short papers, and a final research project that took the form of a 1500-2000 word blog post. Reviewers agreed that the workload was manageable, but two students emphasized that doing all the readings was important, since the class was mainly discussion-based. On average students spent two to six hours per week on this course.\nOverall, the majority of reviewers enjoyed \u201cProtest and Dissidence in Iran.\u201d Students did emphasize that this is a discussion-based course with the professor acting mainly as a moderator, and one reviewer indicated that they would have liked to spend slightly more time learning about Persian culture and language. However, reviewers highly recommended this first year seminar, finding the assignments and content interesting and manageable, and noted Professor Quay's passion and expertise.

The class consisted mostly of lectures by Professor Alabi, with some discussions and Kahoots to encourage student participation.\nThe majority of the course grade was based on four \u201cUnit Wrap\u201d assignments due at the end of every unit.

Any language course was considered useful experience by reviewers, but no prerequisites were necessary. Some respondents recommended that students interested in more specific topics within intercultural competence take other classes, as this course is a general overview.\nStudents appreciated Professor Jane Sokolowsky\u2019s policy on assignment revisions as well as how she encouraged students to speak in class. However, some wished discussion was a more central part of the course. Lectures were deemed long, and some individuals suggested that more in-depth questions could challenge students to engage in the subject in a more meaningful manner.\nThe course requirements consisted of weekly modules, which included readings and discussion posts on Canvas. Other assignments included two to three short research papers and a final video project. Students remarked that they enjoyed the readings, but wished Professor Sokolowksy had given more specific directions for the papers.\nOverall, respondents recommended this course for those considering an intercultural competency certificate, but suggested that other classes may be more compelling for students with a strong background in the subject.

No previous experience with Latin is required, although a basic understanding of the principles of English grammar was reported to be helpful.\nThe class gave Professor Joseph Reed rave reviews for his receptiveness to students\u2019 questions and thorough explanations of the language\u2019s trickier components. A couple respondents called his teaching style \u201ccasual\u201d and \u201cconversational.\" Under Professor Reed\u2019s instruction, students were satisfied with how much Latin they learned and were motivated to continue studying the language. However, one student noted that they wished more time had been spent going over exercises instead of listening to lectures.\nCoursework included daily homework assignments, five quizzes, readings, two midterms, and a final exam. All respondents agreed that they found the assignments to be relevant and somewhat difficult. While some noted that the pace of the course was very fast, students felt comfortable as they were not expected to learn everything perfectly on the first try.\nOverall, reviewers found this class to be a solid and enjoyable introduction to Latin and were \u201cimpressed with how much Latin (they) learned\" in just the first semester. While the time requirement was heavy, respondents encouraged prospective students who are interested in Latin or historical literature in general to take this rewarding class.

In \"Introduction to Latin Literature,\" students improve their reading of Latin poetry and prose by studying and translating ancient Latin literature, paying close attention to grammar and style. The prerequisites for this course are LATN0100 and LATN0200. Students agreed that a strong background in Latin grammar was essential for success, and an interest in Classics and the culture of Ancient Rome was helpful but not necessary.\nRespondents agreed that Instructor Philbrick was an effective, engaging, and enthusiastic instructor. She made sure to go over grammar concepts that were unclear in the readings, and deconstructed complex grammatical structures into the simplest terms. During class, students were encouraged to interrupt with questions and discuss the translation. The instructor enforced participation by calling on students to translate in class. Outside of class, students found that Philbrick was available and gave helpful feedback during office hours and through email.\nAssignments for this class included readings to translate, four quizzes, a midterm exam, one presentation, a final paper, and a final exam. Students had high praise for the readings, which were various passages from Latin literature chosen by the instructor. One respondent noted that it would have been helpful to receive more material reinforcement, such as a sheet of vocabulary and rhetorical devices for each reading.\nStudents spent an average of __ hours and a maximum of __ hours per week on this class. Respondents generally agreed that the work for the class was time consuming, but worth it, though some noted that an interest in Latin is necessary to appreciate the information presented in the course. One respondent noted that \"Introduction to Latin Literature\" is a good intermediate class for those who took Latin in high school and are not ready for 1000 level Latin courses or for those who look LATN0100 and LATN0200.

This upper level Latin course required a strong background in the Latin language, and some students noted that even with many years of experience, this was a hard work to translate. Despite the difficulty, however, reviewers described the text as \u201cdelightful\u201d and \u201cfun,\u201d and many felt that their translation skills improved over the course of the semester.\nStudents had nothing but praise for Professor Bodel, whom they called \u201cbrilliant\u201d and \u201ccaptivating.\u201d Many commented on his clarity and ability to help students through in-class translation and noted that he offered numerous original and interesting interpretations of the text. The one criticism expressed was the feeling that his tendency to let them volunteer to translate rather than calling on students was somewhat ineffective. However, respondents found his analysis of the text thorough and engaging.\nIn addition to reading and translating the Satyricon, work for this course was comprised of one paper, a midterm, and a final exam. For the most part, reviewers found this appropriate. Some even commented that it was the \u201cperfect amount\u201d of work, though one student suggested that it would be helpful not to have the midterm and paper due the same week. Respondents unanimously enjoyed the Satyricon, consistently pointing out its humor, relevance to Roman social history and culture, and literary value.\nMost people spent between four and six hours per week working for this course, which they found acceptable. Reviewers encouraged other students to shop other upper level Latin courses to ensure the text is one they\u2019re interested in, but added that the \u201chilarious, seedy Latin\u201d found in the Satyricon was worth studying, and that \u201cyou won\u2019t read the Satyricon with anyone better.\u201d\n\ninstructor: Instructors\nJohn Bodel\njohn_bodel@brown.edu\n\nschedule: Schedule and Location\nMWF 2pm-2:50pm in Friedman Hall 003\n\naverage_hours: 4.44\n\nmax_hours: 6.71\n\ncourse_rating: 43%\n4.53\n\nprofessor_rating: 64%\n4.79\n\nprofessor_and_term: LATN 1110J | Bodel, John (S1) | Spring 2010\n\n", "code: LATN 1110X\n\nterm: Fall 2024\n\ntitle: Selections from Latin Authors: Ovid, Ars Amatoria\n\ndescription: At Brown, learning the Art of Love doesn't have to be merely an extracurricular activity. In fact, in \"Selections from Latin Authors: Ovid (Ars Amatoria),\" Brunonians read and discuss themes from the first and third book of Ars Amatoria and Remedia Amoris. A sound foundation in Latin grammar, as well as experience with reading other original poetry were important to successful completion of the course: two respondents specifically recommended having taken a course on Horace and Catullus with Professor Debrohun.\nRespondents praised Professor Joseph Reed for his emphasis on grammar, skillful lecturing, and patience for less experienced members of the class. Some mentioned that he went off on tangents: \"Reed is fun and exciting, but can get distracted easily--just like Ovid,\" wrote one. Because of how Professor Reed structured the class, students found participation in discussion absolutely necessary but also effortless and enjoyable.\nThe course load consisted of weekly short quizzes, two midterms, and one final essay. Students remarked that this amount of work met their initial expectations, was appropriate for them to attain course goals, and, in particular, was well-scheduled to maximize learning and minimize stress.\nThough the works students in this class read throughout the course of the semester are among the most celebrated examples of didactic poetry and satire, students enrolled were clearly not taking this course simply because they had to.

One class member noted that she really cared about the student experience in the class as \u201cshe worked hard to make sure I became more confident in my poetry writing throughout the course and even brought in my particular interests.\u201d Former students would encourage all who wish to explore the intriguing field of poetry to take a look at this course.\n\ninstructor: Instructors\nTBD\n\nschedule: Schedule and Location\nW 5:40pm-8:10pm in Page-Robinson Hall 201\n\naverage_hours: 2.00\n\nmax_hours: 4.00\n\ncourse_rating: 39%\n4.22\n\nprofessor_rating: 61%\n4.58\n\nprofessor_and_term: LITR 0110B | Morris, Kendall (S4) | Fall 2021\n\n", "code: LITR 0110E\n\nterm: Spring 2025\n\ntitle: Screenwriting I\n\ndescription: *Please note that this course was taught online \u2013 this review may not be reflective of future semesters*\n\u201cScreenwriting I\u201d (LITR0110E) is a workshop in the Literary Arts Department which requires prospective students to apply through a lottery-waitlist procedure on the Literary Arts website. The course regularly meets weekly with a two-and-a-half-hour section. Courses such as \u201cPlaywriting I\u201d (TAPS0100) or the sequel, \u201cPlaywriting II\u201d (TAPS0200) are cited as being comparable in structure to Screenwriting. Similar to Playwriting courses, Screenwriting has an upper-level course, \u201cAdvanced Screenwriting\u201d (LITR1010E).\nProfessor Laura Colella was described as an engaging and active professor who made the class notable. Professor Colella was described as encouraging, creative, and effective in aiding the students with their work. Though the class had a two-and-a-half-hour weekly meeting, Professor Colella was able to maintain the focus and enjoyment of the students while also allowing for a continued sense of learning.\nProjects and work vary every semester, but this semester, coursework included writing two screenplays, which took the role of the midterm and final. Several other group assignments focused on the discussion of films. Other homework included a number of readings as well as viewings of screenplays. Students found the projects and work to be interesting and rewarding.\nOverall, students said \u201cScreenwriting I\u201d was an effective, interesting, and enjoyable introductory class to Brown\u2019s Literary Arts Department. Due to the significant in-class time commitment, students were able to bond with each other and with the professor. The course allowed students to understand and develop their own writing styles while also allowing them to explore a more analytical side of screenwriting.\n\ninstructor: Instructors\nLaura Colella\nlaura_colella@brown.edu\n\nschedule: Schedule and Location\nM 3pm-5:30pm Location TBD\n\naverage_hours: 4.33\n\nmax_hours: 8.33\n\ncourse_rating: 41%\n4.33\n\nprofessor_rating: 63%\n4.72\n\nprofessor_and_term: LITR 0110E | Colella, Laura (S1) | Spring 2021\n\n", "code: LITR 0110H\n\nterm: Fall 2024\n\ntitle: Digital & Cross-Disciplinary Language Arts 1\n\ndescription: Project-oriented workshop for writers and language artists who want to integrate practices from other disciplines as they devise, compose, and make their work.

Although this workshop has no official prerequisites, non-concentrators have to submit a writing sample in order to enroll. Many students mentioned that they had taken \"Fiction I\" (LITR0110A) or other creative writing courses.\nProfessor Unigwe was well-received by her students, with one even exclaiming, \"Chika is a wonderful and funny woman! 10/10 would recommend.\" Respondents remarked that she sometimes had trouble controlling class but appreciated her feedback on their writing and noted that she encouraged everyone to participate in class. They also enjoyed how she incorporated African literature into the course. Reviewers noted that Professor Unigwe was very accessible and responded promptly to emails.\nAssignments for the course included one short story a week, weekly readings, and a final portfolio of their stories. All students had their work workshopped twice during the semester. Respondents found these assignments to be highly relevant and, for the most part, not difficult, though there were some that noted that the work would sometimes be overwhelming.\nOverall, students enjoyed Professor Unigwe and her class, but recommended more in-class exercises, more relevant PowerPoint slides on writing techniques, and fully discussing the weekly readings in future iterations of this course. For those interested in the course, reviewers recommended also shopping other Literary Arts workshops, including \"Fiction I\" (LITR0110A), \"Poetry I\" (LITR0110B), and \"Poetry Writing II\" (LITR0210B).

In addition to improving poetry-writing abilities, the course is also intended to foster the skills of reading, writing, discussing, and evaluating poetry. With the exception of declared Literary Arts concentrators, students must submit an application for this course, but it has no formal prerequisites. Other workshops were found to be a helpful background, but not necessary to take the course.\nStephen Williams, the instructor of the course, was generally well-liked by his students. The students wrote that he was interesting but very laid back, he was praised for his ability to make everyone feel comfortable and create an environment for open class discussion. According to the respondents, he made himself very available to meet, and really let students choose how the class was run. Though some reviewers said that this sometimes led to awkward silences, the class tended to enjoy their group workshops. Respondents also commented on his thoughtful and positive feedback on their work. The general consensus was that while he was not always the most effective instructor, he was always engaged and eager to discuss.\nSurvey respondents were split in their opinions on the assigned readings. Some found it a great selection, but many felt that the text choices were perhaps a bit too avant-garde. Some also felt that the reading list was excessive. Other than readings, the course required students to write a poem every week, and on final 3-5 page response paper.\nThe amount of time spent outside of class for Poetry II varied, but students generally felt that the workload was reasonable. Students recommended the course enthusiastically to others, but with the caveat that you should be sure you actually like writing poetry. Though feedback from peers is not always constructive, most respondents highly suggested taking this or another Literary Arts workshop at Brown if you are at all interested.\n\ninstructor: Instructors\nCarolina Ebeid\ncarolina_ebeid@brown.edu\n\nschedule: Schedule and Location\nW 3pm-5:30pm in 70 Brown Street 130\n\naverage_hours: 2.46\n\nmax_hours: 4.09\n\ncourse_rating: 54%\n4.03\n\nprofessor_rating: 80%\n4.48\n\nprofessor_and_term: LITR 0210B | Williams, Stephen (S1) | Spring 2010\n\n", "code: LITR 0310O\n\nterm: Fall 2024\n\ntitle: Narrative Nonfiction\n\ndescription: This is a class in crafting engrossing and essential stories.

The class has no official prerequisites, but some students found it helpful to have some background in reading for critical analysis.\nProfessor Sawako Nakayasu was praised by her students as a wonderful instructor and discussion facilitator. She was described as easygoing, compassionate, and receptive to student needs. However, some reviewers felt that the class discussions could have been more structured and that the professor could have provided more critical and constructive feedback. Outside of class, the professor made herself very available, with one student describing her as \u201cpassionate about seeing us succeed.\u201d\nCourse assignments included eight books read on a weekly or biweekly basis, each followed by a three-page response paper. Students did not find the assignments difficult, but noted that they were somewhat time-consuming. Overall, class members found the assigned books both relevant and helpful. One reviewer commented that the \u201cwide range of material [covered in class] always gave me something to think about.\u201d\nStudents enjoyed this course. They loved the opportunity to meet and have conversations with the authors they had been reading. In addition, reviewers also loved Professor Nakayasu and appreciated the opportunity to listen to other students\u2019 stories. As for future improvements for the course, respondents recommended the professor lead longer and more structured discussions and provide a more clear grading rubric. Fellow students are recommended to take this class and also to shop related classes like \u201cIntroduction to Fiction\u201d (LITR100A), \u201cIntroduction to Poetry\u201d (LITR100B), and \u201cIntroduction to Creative Nonfiction\u201d (ENGL0930).\n\ninstructor: Instructors\nMatthew Shenoda\nmatthew_shenoda@brown.edu\n\nschedule: Schedule and Location\nTh 4pm-6:30pm in 70 Brown Street 130\n\nprograms: Curricular Programs\nFirst Year Seminar (FYS)\nWriting - Designated Courses (WRIT)\n\naverage_hours: 5.93\n\nmax_hours: 8.62\n\ncourse_rating: 58%\n4.37\n\nprofessor_rating: 84%\n4.70\n\nprofessor_and_term: LITR 0710 | Nakayasu, Sawako (S1) | Spring 2018\n\n", "code: LITR 1010A\n\nterm: Fall 2024\n\ntitle: Advanced Fiction\n\ndescription: \"Advanced Fiction\" is an upper-level writing seminar designed to allow student writers to improve their craft through readings and in-class workshops. Though there are no formal prerequisites, all participants must receive written permission from the instructor; many reported that they had taken Fiction I and Fiction II prior to taking this course.\nRespondents praised Professor Aidoo for creating a supportive atmosphere, in which writers could feel free to try new things and learn from mistakes. However, the majority of the respondents felt that the class was not structured enough, that she did not give enough direct feedback on students' writing, and did not keep discussions about the books on topic. One respondent noted that her style of workshops was \"unconventional,\" and that some system should be developed so that students could read each others' writings before class, so that they would have more time to critique in class. Another expressed regret that there were so few short assignments or prompted exercises.\nFor this seminar, Professor Aidoo's selection of readings was entirely written by African-American authors. There was no consensus on the professor's choice: some enjoyed the new perspectives and noted that such works were underrepresented in the literary arts department, while others expressed that they would have liked a wider range of settings and thoughts. One respondent said that the readings were not popular with the class. Many reported that they enjoyed the readings, but several noted that they were largely irrelevant to their development as writers.\nBesides very few short exercises, students were expected to write 40 pages of fiction as a final project. This matched students' expectations, with most spending three to five hours a week on the class. Several students noted that time management skills and self motivation were very important, as there were few \"checkpoint\" deadlines before the entire 40 page project was due.\nOverall, \"Advanced Fiction\" with Professor Aidoo is one of many classes available to advanced writers at Brown University. Respondents suggested Advanced Poetry or any course in Africana Studies as alternatives or supplements to this course and urged students to shop fiction seminars until they found a professor that was a good fit for them.\n\ninstructor: Instructors\nLucy Ives\nlucy_ives@brown.edu\n\nschedule: Schedule and Location\nW 3pm-5:30pm in Page-Robinson Hall 302\n\nprograms: Curricular Programs\nWriting - Designated Courses (WRIT)\n\naverage_hours: N/A\n\nmax_hours: N/A\n\ncourse_rating: 34%\n3.61\n\nprofessor_rating: 72%\n3.59\n\nprofessor_and_term: LITR 1010A | Aidoo, Ama Ata (S3) | Fall 2008\n\n", "code: LITR 1010B\n\nterm: Fall 2024\n\ntitle: Advanced Poetry\n\ndescription: Course work includes a body of exercises, close reading of poetry, workshop conversations and conferences.

Or been curious about the Ivy Film Festival at Brown? If so, \u201cAdvanced Screenwriting\u201d (LITR1010E), which focuses on screenwriting for feature-length and episodic works, might be the course for you! Because of the course\u2019s advanced nature and the expectation that participants have experience writing short screenplays, numerous reviewers noted that they previously took the introductory screenwriting course before applying for placement in LITR1010E, which is based on writing samples and determined during the first week of shopping period.\nRespondents praised Professor Laura Colella\u2019s seminar facilitation abilities, noting her instruction style as effective. The class is discussion heavy, which students often led; one student described this teaching style as \u201cboth an advantage and disadvantage, depending on your preferences.\u201d To expand upon this classroom dynamic, as per a reviewer\u2019s experience, the instructor \u201clet the class hear from everyone else before they give their notes in class. After class, they send you much more detailed notes on an annotated PDF of your script. They are always happy to answer questions in and outside of class.\u201d Reviewers commended Professor Colella\u2019s knowledge of writing and the production side of screenwriting.\n\u201cAdvanced Screenwriting\u201d is an S/NC course, with grading broken down as follows: 70% for quality and timeliness of assignments, 30% for attendance and participation. Assignments include Canvas responses to films viewed weekly, turning in pages towards the final script assignment, and leading a class discussion with a partner on a film of your choice. By the end of the semester, it is expected that students will have written at least 30-60 pages of polished screenplay pages; thus, many assignments work towards this end goal. Class participants are also required to read their peers\u2019 scripts.\nIf this is your first experience with screenwriting, prospective students are advised to take the regular screenwriting workshop first! However, if screenwriting is your passion, you should highly consider taking this course. Passion is key as \u201cyou get out of it what you put in. If you\u2019re not passionate about screenwriting and able to write a lot, don\u2019t take it.\u201d Another factor to consider is the student-led aspect of class discussion; one reviewer advised, \u201cthis helped us talk about areas of film/ TV/ screenwriting that we are most interested in, but it also could\u2019ve been helpful to sometimes have more structure to our discussions.\u201d As well, LITR1010E is fast paced and involves an extensive revision process.

We shall raise questions about the kind of research this project entails, the ethics of writing about kin, how to work creatively with photographs, audio, objects and documents, and how to write into that empty gap of what's missing from the archive.\n\ninstructor: Instructors\nCarolina Ebeid\ncarolina_ebeid@brown.edu\n\nschedule: Schedule and Location\nM 3pm-5:30pm in Smith-Buonanno Hall G13\n\ncritical_review_url: http://www.thecriticalreview.org/LITR/1152X\n\n", "code: LITR 1152Z\n\nterm: Fall 2024\n\ntitle: Creative Process Workshop\n\ndescription: Creative Writing can be understood as a method of turning ideas, sounds, images, snippets, fragments, dreams, research -- and any and all of life's materials -- into fully realized literary works. The \"work\" of these works is hidden when we read books and published authors, and thus our sense of how excellent work is achieved can be underdeveloped or perfectionistic. When we rely on only a reader's perspective to guide us as artists, it provides little to no sense of artistic path. The path that an artist takes to develop a work is one that is non-linear, messy, and full of wonderful byways. It doesn't easily fit into an editorial perspective, and thus the way in which work is discussed will be different from literature courses. This workshop is for writers of all levels to explore in more depth their\n\ninstructor: Instructors\nThalia Field\nthalia_field@brown.edu\n\nschedule: Schedule and Location\nT 11:55am-2:25pm in 70 Brown Street 130\n\ncritical_review_url: http://www.thecriticalreview.org/LITR/1152Z\n\n", "code: LITR 1153A\n\nterm: Fall 2024\n\ntitle: The Illiberal Imagination: Fictions of Disinformation, Conspiracy, and Control\n\ndescription: What do an artist and a politician have in common?

Respondents noted that their experience with literary analysis was helpful, but more important for success in the course was a passion for literature and poetry.\nProfessor Cole Swensen was unanimously praised for her dedication to students and accommodations to their needs. The course is discussion-based, and Professor Swensen, whom students affectionately call \u201cCole,\u201d effectively invited thoughtful discussion and prompted students to share their insights. One respondent described class discussion as an \u201copen dialogue\u201d between the students, Professor Swensen, and the guest author. Respondents also appreciated that Professor Swensen added extra office hours and additional lectures to help students understand the poetry readings, which tended to be the least accessible, and left \u201ccopious feedback\u201d on papers.\nAssignments for \u201cWriters on Writing\u201d included reading one book or poetry chapbook a week, writing a weekly 500-700 word analytical response to the reading, and a weekly 500-700 word creative writing piece inspired by the reading. Students also gave two group presentations throughout the semester to introduce the week\u2019s reading. Respondents noted that the readings could be time consuming; the longest book was 549 pages, and the poetry chapbooks, while shorter, required more effort to comprehend. One respondent advised that prospective students have a strong interest in contemporary fiction because \u201cyou get out of the course what you put into it.\u201d\nStudents enjoyed \u201cWriters on Writing\u201d for both its content and its structure.

Respondents praised the professor for being flexible with her deadlines and her willingness to explain topics more thoroughly. They found the professor to be extremely helpful and responsive to student needs.\nThe coursework consisted of two small homework assignments per week, an open-note midterm, and a take-home final.

While this class has no prerequisites, students reported that background in calculus and trigonometry from high school helped them succeed. MATH0090 is a recommended prerequisite for most STEM concentrations. This course is mandatory S/NC.\nThis section was taught by graduate student Steven Creech. Overall, students thought he was a great instructor who explained the content in a very effective manner. Some respondents wanted more example problems instead of proofs, but understood that it would be difficult to accomplish more in-class problem-solving due to the quick pace of the course.\nThe coursework for MATH0090 consisted of weekly problem sets, two midterms, and a final exam. There was also a required weekly recitation section that had quizzes every other week. Students were in agreement that the weekly homework was difficult, but great practice for exams. They also appreciated that grades were released after exams very quickly.\nMost class members found that while MATH0090 was a course that they took as a requirement, they were pleasantly surprised by how engaging and interesting it was. They felt it was challenging, but a necessary course for completing the introductory calculus sequence. Some advice from students who have taken the course includes reaching out for help early and often.

The course continues topics introduced in MATH0090, discussing integration techniques, infinite series including Taylor series, polar and parametric equations, and basic differential equations. MATH0090 or an equivalent (such as AP Calculus AB) are requirements, and respondents noted that these courses were important for their success.\nProfessor Dan Katz received mixed reviews from students. Many found his teaching to be very effective and clear, appreciating how he would teach a concept and then do several example problems, and noting that the lectures themselves were extremely engaging. Many respondents noted that he was very open to asking questions, though others found that he could be condescending. Some students found that the course went at too fast a pace.\nThe course had weekly homework assignments, low-stakes biweekly quizzes during recitation, two 1.5-hour midterms, and a three-hour final. The two lowest homeworks and quizzes were dropped. Students found that the homework was generally quite time-consuming. There were also optional self-check problems, which students stressed were important toward their understanding although it could be difficult to find the time to do them. Most students averaged around 5 hours per week on assignments outside of class, although there was considerable variation. Students complained that the tests were extremely difficult, and also noted that formula sheets were not allowed on exams, so memorization of formulas was often necessary.\nStudents came away from the class with varying perspectives. Students who found the pace too quick noted that online videos could be more helpful than the lectures, but others found the lectures sufficient and appreciated the interesting nature of the material. Prospective students were advised to keep in mind that the course could be difficult, with one student recommending taking the course S/NC and another student recommending taking the course with a more accommodating professor.

While there are few surprises to be found in the content of the course, the rigor of this course left most with a healthy understanding of multivariable calculus needed to succeed in other STEM classes at Brown. In general, students took this course as a concentration requirement rather than an interest in the subject content alone.\nReviewers described Katz\u2019s teaching style as straightforward and quite rigorous. Many students noted the fast pace of the course, with several describing the ease at which you could fall behind should you fail to stay on top of the required work. Lectures are often crammed with as much content as possible, with answers to student questions often going past the bell. While some reviewers liked that he focussed on student struggles, many others wished he spent more time going over concrete examples. However, many students found \u201cFrom Last Time\u201d five-minute reviews at the beginning of each class helpful to their understanding of the course content.\nStrong study habits are required to succeed in this course. The primary workload consists of weekly homework assignments of 24 questions (12 graded, 12 self-check). Furthermore, there are conference sections with both group problem sets and biweekly quizzes. The two midterm exams and one final exam make up the majority of the final grade. Reviewers described the exams as equally or more difficult than the weekly homework assignments.\nStudents without a preexisting interest in multivariable calculus are generally advised to avoid this course if it is not a concentration requirement.

The course goals include a conceptual understanding of various topics in single-variable calculus and the ability to apply those concepts to work in physics and engineering. Placement in the course is based on high school AP exam scores or scores on placement exams taken at Brown. Unofficial prerequisites include \u201ca firm understanding of calculus in one variable,\u201d including the antiderivatives of many common functions and the proper use of the method of integration by substitution. Survey respondents indicated that a strong background in high school calculus was very important to feel comfortable in the course. Some said that having taken AP Calculus BC is essential for this course while others said that a prospective student with that background (of AP Calc BC) could go straight to MATH0180 or MATH0200.\nThe graduate student who taught the class, Sam Freedman, received very positive feedback from respondents. Multiple students highlighted his excitement and passion for the material, as well as his in-depth and helpful explanations of more complicated topics. One student also said that although the course was designed with physics and engineering applications in mind, that focus did not exclude in-depth coverage of the math itself. Another student even went so far as to say that Freedman was \u201cmy favorite professor this semester\u201d and that \u201cwhile he sometimes went off on tangents, this made the class so much more engaging.\u201d\nThe course grade was broken down into many sections, including quizzes, section participation, problem sets, additional \u201ccapstone problem sets,\u201d one \u201ccomputational midterm,\u201d and a take-home final exam. There were also relatively generous cutoffs for letter grades, with the cutoff between A and B \u201cmost likely \u2026 between 85% and 90%.\u201d The quizzes, proctored on MyLab, were more computational in nature, whereas the regular problem sets were more conceptual. Also, a full rubric for the latter questions was available on Canvas. The two capstone problem sets, which tested students' problem-solving skills, weighted much higher than the other ones and were meant to be \u201cmore challenging and time consuming than your standard problem sets.\" The computational midterm was essentially designed as an evolution of the MyLab quizzes, whereas the final exam was more akin to a capstone problem set. Students were given 48 hours to complete the final. At the end of the semester, students\u2019 lowest grades in the homework and conference sections were dropped. No late assignments were ever accepted.\nRespondents\u2019 overall impression of the class was very positive, with special emphasis given to the enthusiasm and strong teaching skills of the instructing graduate student, Sam Freedman.

Respondents strongly recommended adhering to the encouraged prerequisite of \u201cIntroductory Calculus, Part II\u201d (MATH0100) or an equivalent such as AP Calculus BC. It was also noted that those interested should have a basic understanding of vectors and their manipulations.\nProfessor Justin Holmer received overwhelming praise for his effectiveness in presenting the materials of the course. He provided lecture notes that allowed students to focus on the concepts being presented and not get distracted by attempting to recreate graphs or diagrams. His asynchronous, video-recorded lectures followed the general pattern of presenting topics and then methodically working through relevant problems, which many felt was extremely helpful in working through homework and quiz questions. However, many respondents also felt this often made lectures dry and tedious, especially given his penchant for long lectures, often capping at four hours a week. Despite his long lectures, students were very appreciative of how he presented material, with one even calling him \u201cone of the best math professors [they\u2019ve] had.\u201d\nThe assignments for the course consisted of quizzes, problem sets, two midterms, and a final. The quizzes were posted at the beginning of each week and due on Friday. Both lectures and TA sections were noted as being helpful for coursework. Respondents deemed the exams to be fair representations of the material covered in the course and the problems worked through during lecture. It was recommended that the best way to study was by completing as many problems as possible, especially alongside the lecture videos.\nIn general, reviewers greatly enjoyed the class and Professor Holmer. Anyone needing to take an intermediate calculus course or interested in the material was strongly encouraged to shop this class, especially as an alternative to MATH0180.

There are no official prerequisites, but students recommend a very strong background in \u201cTopology\u201d (MATH1410) and other graduate level algebra courses to do well.\nClass material was taught through three weekly lectures. Some students found that the course ran through the material too fast in the hour-long time slot. That being said, students praised Professor Sulyma for his approachability during office hours and through emails and recommended that prospective students utilize those resources well.\nThe total coursework included bi-weekly problem sets and one final take-home exam. Students found that extra reading was often necessary to tackle the topics and problems presented in the homeworks and on exams, but Professor Sulyma was able to introduce the important concepts in the textbook well and was an overall great help in the learning process.\nOverall, MATH2410 is a \u201cpretty standard graduate course\u201d in its methodology and introduction of algebraic topology. Students found it unanimously challenging, but many felt that was expectable of an advanced math course. Students should expect to spend many additional hours digesting the material.

Reviewers also noted that TAs did all of the grading which many respondents found to be harsh. Outside of class, Professor Pozo and the TAs held office hours that some students found helpful.\nCoursework for \"Digital Media\" included weekly readings, labs, screenings, three essays of 500-1000 words, a 2500-5000 word final project that expanded on one of the shorter papers, and a multimedia presentation of the final project. The shorter written assignments were each done in a different style: a review, a personal essay, and an analytical essay. There was some discrepancy among reviewers regarding the difficulty of assignments, but the general consensus was that the paper topics were a little too ambitious with complex topics and requirements. Readings could also be long and challenging to understand.\nOverall, students found course materials to be interesting, very contemporary, and very relevant. One reviewer felt that the class \"engaged with gender and sexuality in really cool ways,\" and another indicated that the class includes some sexual content. To improve the course in the future, students suggested building better connection between lecture and sections, as the learning objectives of each session were not always clear.

This course focuses on government surveillance, looking at drones, border surveillance and war media, but extends to other sites such as the factory and workplace. Key threads here will be the origins of contemporary surveillance in capitalism, colonialism, and empire. Throughout the semester we will attend to how some are disproportionately targeted according to race, gender, sexual orientation, class, disability, religion, and citizenship. We will also ask what it means to resist surveillance, with particular attention to surveillance in contemporary visual culture. This entails asking what it means to look back and how not to be seen.\n\ninstructor: Instructors\nHenry Osman\nhenry_osman@brown.edu\n\nschedule: Schedule and Location\nT 4pm-6:30pm Location TBD\n\nprograms: Curricular Programs\nWriting - Designated Courses (WRIT)\n\ncritical_review_url: http://www.thecriticalreview.org/MCM/0903C\n\n", "code: MCM 0903D\n\nterm: Spring 2025\n\ntitle: Diagnostic Media\n\ndescription: What does it mean to interpret and \u201cdiagnose\u201d?

In this course, we will explore \u201cdiagnostics\u201d and \u201cdiagnostic media\u201d as a specific way media is used to build meaning about others and ourselves. This course will be shaped around two key facets of diagnostics: diagnostics as a media form, and diagnostics a mode of encounter.

To answer this question, this course attends to the particulars of the computer as a mathematical proposition, to its claim to legitimacy as a logic of superior military and political organization, and to its elaboration as something of a natural philosophy in scientific practice. In doing so, we will formulate a conceptual basis to critically assess the glittery promises of current discourse invoking Artificial Intelligence (A.I), which sees near-total automation as inevitable and the threat of sentient Artificial General Intelligence (A.G.I) as nigh. We will establish a critique of the computer as a structure (as a philosophical arrangement with a specific and persistent imagination) to think critically about popular ideologies associated with A.I., often put forward by those with capital stake in its commercial success.\n\ninstructor: Instructors\nLachlan Kermode\nlachlan_kermode@brown.edu\n\nschedule: Schedule and Location\nT 4pm-6:30pm in 155 George Street 106\n\nprograms: Curricular Programs\nWriting - Designated Courses (WRIT)\n\ncritical_review_url: http://www.thecriticalreview.org/MCM/0903E\n\n", "code: MCM 0903F\n\nterm: Fall 2024\n\ntitle: Black Love: Slavery and Sexuality on Screen\n\ndescription: Is love a luxury in the time of racial terror?

Rather than a linear history of nightlife and club culture, in each week we venture to a new theme/destination. We explore the spaces, the dancing, the outfits, the laws and legal gray areas, the drag, the cruising, and the rumbling bass, textures, and frequencies of queer nightlife. Through close readings, guest speakers, site visits and sustained cultural analysis, we acquire a critical understanding of the potentialities of queer \"after hours\" in the making of subcultural identity and emerging aesthetic practices.

What kinds of visualities, imaginaries, and memories guide how we imagine South America, Chile? What are the roles of art, video, performance, and memorials as sites of emplacing memory, collective witness, creating future possibilities? Our thinking, making, and engagement is guided by social, cultural, feminist, and environmental movements and explore modes of sensing, creating, feeling and being with the land through Indigenous, migrant, \u201cexpert\u201d and local knowledge and place.

This peculiar method of construction has piqued the attention not only of film theorists, who look to Hitchcock to teach them about technique, but also philosophers, who look to him to help them thing more clearly about the nature of thinking, promising, doubting, and obsession.

Formations of television and race not only remain pressing concerns but are intertwined, mutually constructing one another. This course explores how notions of race have been mediated and how media have figured race.

Yet in the discussion of the ocean\u2019s degradation, too often we write out racial and extractive capitalism from our current understanding of the Anthropocene, the era of human-led disaster. When we speak of the oceans as diminished, or a site for resource extraction, we also write out the dynamism of the sea as a protagonist in the history of the human. This course places the ocean at the center of our analysis to understand the root causes of its deterioration, centrally engaging with the unequal histories of colonialism and their afterlives. By exploring the comparative histories of the Trans-Pacific, Trans-Atlantic, Indian Ocean, Arctic, and Southern Ocean, we address the colonial roots of biodiverse diminishment and extinction, beyond mere land-based or anthropos-centric perspectives.\n\ninstructor: Instructors\nMacarena Gomez-Barris\nmacarena_gomez-barris@brown.edu\n\nschedule: Schedule and Location\nCourse offered online\n\ncritical_review_url: http://www.thecriticalreview.org/MCM/1507T\n\n", "code: MCM 1700D\n\nterm: Spring 2025\n\ntitle: Reframing Documentary Production: Concepts and Questions\n\ndescription: An advanced seminar for students of video and/or film production.

As of late 2021, there are approximately 436 submarine cables sending internet data to servers around the world*. While marketing language reinforces an image of ephemerality, this course is an attempt to reveal its physicality and networked relations behind the screens. We will sift through the cloudiness of metaphor by taking a look at the ground beneath us and learn to recognize some of the networked structures hiding in plain sight and their antecedent industrial infrastructures.

This power can be wielded to determine the shape and direction of historical scholarship, collective memory, and identities, thereby impacting how we know ourselves as individuals, groups, and societies. These links are further complicated in archives where the provenance of collections is unclear. Students will gain a greater understanding of archival organization and authority, and are encouraged to imagine new modes of access to archives forging their own openings into/beyond the archives: making material traces and connections to produce critically engaged, creative works.

The question \u201cwhat is it to read?\u201d animates topics such as close and distant reading; ideology and hermeneutics of suspicion; figures of affect, surface, and repair. Inquiries into form highlight defamiliarization and (a)historicism; plasticity and formlessness; aesthetics and heteroglossia; dissensus and engagement. Articulating questions of form with questions reading refocuses our attention on the work of form: form as process, as productive, as reformation. Our course will approach the issues of subjectivity and theoretical objects, ideology and pleasure, new formalisms and the politics of the aesthetic in theoretical work from the twentieth and twentieth century across the disciplines.

This collaborative humanities course centers perspectives, translations, and mediations from and about the Am\u00e9ricas.

Professor Mark Rivard states that the main goal of the course is to help students gain experience working with radiation and know the protective measures of the equipment. The course is limited to graduate students in the Medical Physics program. There are no official prerequisites but students mentioned that having a deep undergraduate background in physics and chemistry is needed to succeed in the course.\nProfessor Rivard\u2019s teaching style mainly consisted of weekly two hour lectures. Students felt that his slides were very descriptive, and the images helped students get a better understanding of the material. Some respondents felt that the textbook was not ideal as the material was often more different than what was being taught. Although the material was dry sometimes, it was noted that Professor Rivard\u2019s passion towards radiation helped keep the lectures manageable.\n\u201cRadiation Protection and Instrumentation\u201d consisted of eight homework assignments, two in-class exams, and two laboratory experiments. The exams were weighted the most, followed by the labs, and then the homework. Some respondents noted that the course lacked structure, where sometimes the homeworks would be posted 24 to 48 hours before their due date. Students suggested that having homework dates expressed in the syllabus would make the class run smoother. On average, students estimated spending around four to six hours outside of class, which most agreed to be a manageable workload.\nOverall, students enjoyed this course, but felt that the course needed improvement in regards to communication and structure. Professor Rivard\u2019s enthusiasm and passion led to many students enjoying the lectures, but the lack of timeliness and communication made it difficult to plan out assignments. Future students should be aware that this class has heavy emphasis on memorization-based content, but the material is doable.\n\ninstructor: Instructors\nMark Rivard\nmark_rivard@brown.edu\nEric Carver\neric_carver@brown.edu\n\nschedule: Schedule and Location\nW 3:20pm-5:10pm in 225 Dyer Street 456\n\naverage_hours: 4.50\n\nmax_hours: 8.75\n\ncourse_rating: 39%\n4.14\n\nprofessor_rating: 56%\n4.21\n\nprofessor_and_term: MED 2220 | Rivard, Mark (S3) | Fall 2022\n\n", "code: MED 2270A\n\nterm: Fall 2024\n\ntitle: Research and Clinical Practicum for Medical Physics\n\ndescription: Customized for each project Note : 2.5 Credits\n\ninstructor: Instructors\nEdward Walsh\nedward_walsh@brown.edu\nUlrich Langner\nulrich_langner@brown.edu\n\ncritical_review_url: http://www.thecriticalreview.org/MED/2270A\n\n", "code: MED 2310\n\nterm: Fall 2024\n\ntitle: Radiation Biology\n\ndescription: This program provides a comprehensive overview of radiation biology with a particular emphasis on aspects of direct relevance to the practice of radiation oncology.

Utilizing topics related to Greek culture, the course focuses on the four linguistic skills of speaking, listening, reading, and writing. There are no prerequisites for the class.\nProfessor Elissavet Amanatidou was highly praised for being thorough, engaging, efficient, accommodating to student needs, and motivating. Respondents also commented favorably on the group discussions and breakout sessions during class, which they found immersed them in the language very quickly and familiarized them with the practical usages of Greek. Professor Amanatidou also frequently checked in with students to ensure they were learning at the same pace. Some reviewers commented that at times the course\u2019s Canvas page felt slightly disorganized, but the Google Doc schedule that Professor Elsa updated regularly resolved this issue.\nThe course load for MGRK0100 included both written and oral assignments in the forms of daily homework, weekly vocabulary quizzes, and a midterm and final exam. Attendance and participation were also mandatory. Most students often spent about five hours per week completing the assignments and considered the workload both manageable and essential for success. Some students remarked that the coursework became more challenging as more grammar was learned in the latter half of the course, so regularly attending classes and completing routine assignments were crucial to keep up. It helped that Professor Amanatidou graded assignments and returned helpful feedback timely and fairly.\nIn short, MGRK0100 was enjoyed by students especially because Professor Amanatidou conveyed materials effectively to language learners of any level, challenging and empowering them to approach the language and continue their studies.

This framework for viewing stakeholders will enable you to strategize about how to engage different actors when and where they intervene in the policy process. As a policymaker, analyst, or advocate, you will have to contend with stakeholders that possess formal authorities to shape the policy process. These stakeholders will determine whether the problems that concern you reach the agenda; whether your preferred solution is adopted; how that policy solution is implemented; whether it diffuses from one political venue to another; and whether the policy endures, or reshapes politics, succumbs to termination or reform.

It covers basic musical terms, elements, and techniques, including notes, scales, rhythm, chords, melody, and harmony. The class involves two weekly labs in which students practice piano and sight-singing. There are no prerequisites for this class, which is explicitly targeted at students with limited or no musical experience. However, respondents did note that some amount of exposure to music and music theory \u2014 like having previously played an instrument \u2014 was very helpful. This class satisfies part of the music theory requirement for the Music concentration, though students also highly recommended it to non-concentrators.\nRespondents spoke warmly of both Professor Cheung and Professor Welch, with one calling them \u201cabsolutely fantastic.\u201d According to students, the instructors were highly effective at presenting material, included lots of examples of concepts, and were very organized. Additionally, respondents said the instructors were highly engaging, receptive to student needs, and accommodating. Reviewers stressed that Professors Cheung and Welch created a fun, relaxed environment in which to learn music theory, which they greatly appreciated.\nMUSC0400A had weekly homework assignments that consisted of textbook reading and exercises as well as occasional short response papers. Again, this class also required biweekly piano labs that met outside of class time. Larger assignments included two take-home exams and an individual final project in which students wrote a song. Respondents noted that this class could require a significant investment of time to learn the material and that doing the homework was important to learning.\nOverall, reviewers highly recommended this class to students interested in music theory who are willing to put in the effort to learn.

It is the first part of a year-long course progression; students are encouraged to take MUSC0560 or MUSC0570 in the spring. Students are required to take a placement course at the beginning of the semester to ensure they are prepared for the course, and most students took MUSC0400A/B and had extensive experience playing a musical instrument before taking \u201cTheory of Tonal Music I.\u201d\nProfessor Mark Steinbach combined lecture with student participation; respondents praised his use of the whiteboard and external camera to show \u201cworked examples\u201d over the Zoom format. Professor Steinbach was described as \u201cincredibly passionate\u201d and dedicated to facilitating student engagement. He did this by cold-calling students throughout class, which respondents found to be stressful but effective at ensuring they paid attention. Professor Steinbach had high expectations for his students, but he was compassionate and never got upset if students did not know an answer. He also encouraged students\u2019 questions.\n\u201cTheory of Tonal Music I\u201d was a time-intensive course. Students were required to complete readings prior to each class, workbook exercises and homework corrections twice a week, a two-hour midterm exam, and a final exam. Students were also required to sign up for a lab that met hourly three times a week. Respondents reported spending 2-4 hours on each homework assignment, and the lab was described as time-consuming for a fifth course.\nStudents enjoyed MUSC0550, but they warn prospective shoppers to be ready for the intense time commitment. Professor Steinbach will be remembered for his \u201cjovial attitude\u201d that created a relaxed environment and made attendance worthwhile.

Respondents also widely noted that previous experience with musicianship or AP/IB Music in high school made course material easier to understand.\nStudents praised Professor Lu Wang\u2019s new and intriguing perspective on tonal harmony. While a few respondents thought that she was disorganized, prone to going on tangents, and occasionally made \u201cunorthodox analogies,\u201d students overall appreciated her enthusiasm for the subject. Respondents also described Professor Wang as soft-spoken at times, so they recommended active engagement with lecture material.\nCourse requirements consisted of labs and homework assignments for each class, weekly quizzes, two individual projects, and two in-class exams. Because most of the assignments took place during class time, students didn't need to spend too many hours on coursework outside of class. Most weeks, students only spent three hours preparing for class, but during heavier weeks, the number could rise to eight.\nReviewers overall enjoyed the class but strongly emphasized the importance of taking MUSC0550 as \"Theory of Tonal Music\" requires a great deal of technical knowledge covered in the prerequisite.

Auditions for the chorus are held each fall and students are admitted based on their musical ability and sight reading skills.\nProfessor Frederick Jodry received rave reviews from his students. He was described as energetic, fun and extremely talented. Many reviewers lauded his humorous anecdotes and said that his enthusiasm for the class kept them engaged and attentive. Some survey respondents noted that Jodry could be disorganized and others felt that he could have incorporated more student input when selecting the music for the semester. However, overall Jodry was praised as being a competent and exciting instructor.\nSince this is a performance group, there were no labs, tests or papers. Instead, students performed in 2 concerts, which were enjoyable and rewarding after many hours of rehearsal.\nReviewers spent anywhere from zero to six hours per week practising their music, and all felt that this level of effort matched their initial expectations. This class was highly recommended to anyone with a strong background in music who loves to sing and is interested in exploring different types of choral music.\n\ninstructor: Instructors\nKevin Plouffe\nkevin_plouffe@brown.edu\n\nschedule: Schedule and Location\nMW 6pm-7:20pm in Grant Recital 105\n\naverage_hours: N/A\n\nmax_hours: N/A\n\ncourse_rating: 33%\n4.69\n\nprofessor_rating: 51%\n4.47\n\nprofessor_and_term: MUSC 0620 | Jodry, Louis Frederick (S1) | Spring 2003\n\n", "code: MUSC 0630\n\nterm: Fall 2024\n\ntitle: Jazz Band\n\ndescription: Half credit each semester.

The course covers diverse styles of African music, as well as drumming, dancing, and singing, which the ensemble performs in concert. There are no prerequisites for this course, although one student mentioned that his/her experience as a beatboxer was helpful; other prior musical experience might be similarly helpful.\nKwaku Kwaakye Obeng received positive reviews from his students. Survey respondents universally approved of his effective presentations, management of class time, as well as his passion for the material. One student specifically commented, \u201c[he] was amazing! He made the course accessible to non-musically-inclined students.\u201d While there was some disagreement about whether the grading was timely and whether he was receptive to the needs of his students, most students responded positively.\nSurvey respondents did not describe any assignments for this course besides practicing the rhythms of this style of music. It should be noted that in the past years, the coursework included readings, podcasts, and videos to support in-class discussions. As this was a performing ensemble, there were weekly meetings on Mondays and Wednesdays as well as a concert at the end of the semester in May.\nOverall, survey respondents universally agreed that they enjoyed the course and learned a lot from it. Students were pleased with Professor Obeng's instruction and would recommend this course to anyone.

Look no further than \u201cOld-Time String Band\u201d (MUSC0670)! This repertoire-based class allows students to delve into American and Appalachian music through in-depth engagement with historically rich dance music. While this course has no official Brown prerequisites, basic knowledge of a primary instrument, including basic scales and chords, is required for placement. Primary instruments include the fiddle, banjo, guitar, ukulele, mandolin, dulcimer, cello, and bass, and students were welcome to try out different instruments during the semester. Respondents indicated that while it was possible to enter the course as an amateur at an instrument, it made learning each piece more challenging.\nRespondents praised instructor Sandol Astrausky as effective at sharing her love for this style of music with the group. All music instruction was taught aurally with melodies being committed to memory. Students appreciated the instructor\u2019s patience in teaching each tune, with many articulating that she would play the piece at full speed once before slowly repeating it until each student understood the melody. Beyond the weekly class sessions, supplemental videos were provided by the instructor to facilitate individual practice, which students found very helpful to their learning experience.\nWhile MUSC0670 had no official assignments, students were encouraged to engage with field recordings of the repertoire as a means to build stylistic intuition. While some respondents who were newer to their selected instrument reported having to spend extra time to learn the music outside of class sessions, others who came in with more experience perceived the repertoire to be much easier to pick up. Class participation and attendance each comprised half of the final grade.\nStudents unanimously agreed that Old-Time String Band was an amazing experience and the perfect escape from a strenuous course load. Its laidback atmosphere and fun energy made class sessions an enjoyable time for all respondents, and many noted that they found it to be a great environment to make new friends.

Since this is the second half of a two-semester course, it must be taken after MU 67. This course requires a bit of rhythm and musical ability, as enrollment is by audition. Otherwise, all you need is a willingness to try new things.\nMost people had good things to say about Mr. Martin Obeng, who taught the course. He was amazingly energetic and passionate about the subject, and did a great job of meeting students\u2019 individual needs. Some, however, complained that he tended to ramble. Mr. Obeng's teaching style is rather aggressive, which a few people found intimidating, and he sometimes criticized mistakes harshly. However, it's possible that his criticisms were tongue-in-cheek.\nThe course requires no tests, homework or papers; the only requirement is a concert at the end of each semester. You won\u2019t find it hard to complete the assigned readings, as there are none. A CD is available for listening at the library, and many students found it helpful.\nThe course won\u2019t consume much of your time: the most anyone spent on it was 5 hours a week, and 2 hours was a more common figure. Overall, if you enjoy drumming, dancing and singing, then audition for 'Ghanaian Drumming.' Class members unanimously recommended it as an entertaining and mind-expanding course. If you get in, you\u2019ll be rewarded with a fascinating teacher, exposure to a culture which is probably totally new, and an overall great time.\n\ninstructor: Instructors\nLois Finkel\nlois_finkel@brown.edu\n\naverage_hours: N/A\n\nmax_hours: N/A\n\ncourse_rating: 41%\n4.33\n\nprofessor_rating: 66%\n4.12\n\nprofessor_and_term: MUSC 0680 | Obeng, Martin (S1) | Spring 2002\n\n", "code: MUSC 0890\n\nterm: Fall 2024\n\ntitle: The Romantic Generation\n\ndescription: Beethoven\u2019s shadow looms large on the young romantic generation, setting off a collective anxiety of influence unparalleled in musical history. \u201cwhat next?\u201d seemed difficult to answer as Beethoven brought the abstract forms of sonata, symphony, and quartet to unreachable heights. The range of answers gave birth to a musical style that looked backwards into the Baroque for textural density and flow, abandoning the articulated symmetry of the classical phrase, while pushing the harmonic language, musical drama, and effect into new horizons. All the while, the search for alternative structures and points of musical departure, resulted in a new sort of interaction between music and other art forms. Schumann\u2019s E.T.A Hoffman\u2019s inspired character pieces, Berlioz\u2019s program music, the proliferation of the Lied, Liszt\u2019s Dante Sonata and Petrarca sonnets are telling examples of this search for a new musical style and context.\n\ninstructor: Instructors\nSaleem Abboud Ashkar\nsaleem_abboud_ashkar@brown.edu\n\nschedule: Schedule and Location\nT 12pm-2:20pm in Orwig Music Hall 112\n\ncritical_review_url: http://www.thecriticalreview.org/MUSC/0890\n\n", "code: MUSC 0910\n\nterm: Spring 2025\n\ntitle: Medieval and Renaissance Music\n\ndescription: \u201cMedieval and Renaissance Music\u201d (MUSC0910), taught by Professor Louis Jodry, looks into musical world and the surrounding context of Medieval and Renaissance time periods. The course\u2019s goal is to explore music of this time through recordings and readings. The class also emphasizes the benefit of attending live musical events. The official prerequisite for this course is \"Theory of Tonal Music\" (MUSC0550), and students across the board agreed that MUSC0550 and an ability to read music were necessary.\nMany respondents enjoyed the class mainly due to the professor. Students overwhelmingly felt that it was Professor Jodry\u2019s passion for the subject that \u201cmade getting up for a 9am not as terrible as it could be.\" Students loved the interesting music that the class exposed them too. Jodry was available by appointment and through email.\nThe course\u2019s assignments included a midterm, a final, one research paper, two concert response essays, one quiz, one transcription assignment, and readings. Students felt that, while assignments were moderately difficult, they were extremely relevant. Respondents did feel that grading was slow, but detailed.\nReviewers found that the courses typically demanded around four hours of work per week outside the classroom, and the time commitment over doubled to around nine hours per week during work-heavy weeks. Students recommended the course to music concentrators and history enthusiasts for a unique experience. Some suggestions for the course were to improve the course\u2019s structure and learning points, have \u201cclearer expectations,\u201d and involve more compositions.

Students study approaches to film scoring, improvisation, and sound spaces outside of the traditional concert hall. Repertoire from the Renaissance to the present day is used as creative inspiration for students' own compositions.\nIn class, Professor Wang Lu was thought of as having a \"passionate and wise personality\" with a very engaging teaching style. Noted by many respondents as the most unique and memorable aspect of the course, her philosophical remarks regarding the nature of composition and genuine love for music influenced the class atmosphere remarkably. She always had a plan for the class and was very open to questions during class and office hours.\nCoursework consisted of six short exercises assigned to accompany each sub-topic, listening assignments, and a final work concluding in a concert of student premieres. The final composition and concert as well as outside work on composition amounted to roughly four hours outside of class. Students seemed to enjoy the lecture and coursework but found that they wanted more assignments to relate to the lecture instead of just focusing on the final.\nOverall, all respondents expressed satisfaction with the lectures and interactive atmosphere of the class. Most students felt that there should have been clearer grading standards for the coursework as well as a more structured plan to the class. Another suggestion for the class was having fewer assignments but a deeper discussion for each example. Depending on the difficulty of the composition, having a background in music theory, piano, and Sibelius or another music notation software is highly recommended. A challenging but very rewarding course, respondents suggested that students with an interest in composition should definitely shop the class.\n\ninstructor: Instructors\nLu Wang\nlu_wang1@brown.edu\n\nschedule: Schedule and Location\nT 9:30am-11:50am in Orwig Music Hall 112\n\naverage_hours: 3.86\n\nmax_hours: 8.25\n\ncourse_rating: 45%\n3.95\n\nprofessor_rating: 64%\n4.33\n\nprofessor_and_term: MUSC 1100 | Wang, Lu (S1) | Fall 2017\n\n", "code: MUSC 1110\n\nterm: Spring 2025\n\ntitle: Seminar in Composition\n\ndescription: \u201cSeminar in Composition\u201d (MUSC1110) exposes students to various compositional techniques and their broad musical applications. The prerequisites are \u201cTheory of Tonal Music\u201d (MUSC0560) and \u201cIntroduction to Composition\u201d (MUSC1100) or a minimum score of WAIVE in \u2018Graduate Student PreReq.\u2019 However, some students found that extracurricular experience in music and other music theory classes like \u201cTheory of Tonal Music I\u201d (MUSC0550) and \u201cJazz and Pop Harmony\u201d (MUSC0570) also served as helpful background.\nThe class was primarily taught through student-led discussion. Many reviewers described Professor Shawn Jaeger, (or \"Shawn,\" as the students referred to him), as very knowledgeable on the subject matter, and one described him as being \u201cvery effective at prompting discussion.\u201d Another student said that Shawn\u2019s feedback was \u201cexcellent and timely.\u201d However, given that many classes were spent on student presentations, some respondents believed that there wasn\u2019t enough time allocated for lecture. Shawn was very available, always trying to find times to work with students outside of class and emailing them feedback.\nThe assignments for the course included short readings, three class presentations, a midterm composition, and a final composition. For the majority of respondents, an average week entailed three hours or less of outside work, although this number could increase to eight to ten hours on busier weeks. Reviewers found the composition work to be difficult but very enjoyable, relevant, and valuable. Some respondents thought there was too much presentation and research work and not enough composition writing.\nSome respondents hoped for more lecture in place of peer presentation, while others wanted there to be more composition assignments and clearer communication about deadlines.

Respondents noted that high school or college Biology, Chemistry, and Psychology courses were useful but not strictly necessary background for NEUR0010.\nProfessor Michael Paradiso\u2019s teaching style was described as \u201cclear and funny,\u201d and students noted he was a great but fast lecturer. His slides contained large volumes of information, so students were encouraged to go to TA sections for better comprehension. Reviewers also emphasized the importance of asking questions, saying that they received friendly and thorough answers from their professor. Professor Paradiso was also open to responding in a more in-depth manner in office hours.\nThe course requirements were three exams, which were based on the lecture slides and were not individually curved. In addition, NEUR0010 required nine take-home quizzes to gauge one\u2019s own learning and around 19 readings, with one in preparation for each week\u2019s lecture. Many students did not find the readings necessary. This course was quite heavy on memorization, and respondents found that the assignments covered the same material as the lecture slides. They were also content with the exams, as there were many practice exams which could be used as study aids.\nOverall, students enjoyed this class, calling it a great and engaging course which covered interesting information. Prospective students were warned against taking this as an easy class or taking it along with other difficult STEM classes, as a significant amount of time could be needed for memorization depending on the individual. Studying in advance was the number one tip for success in this course.

Topics covered in the course include differential equations, probability theory and computer programming, and some of the most common modern neural-modeling techniques. Prerequisites for this course include \"The Brain: An Introduction to Neuroscience\" (NEUR0010) and \"Introductory Calculus II\"/\"Advanced Placement Calculus\" (MATH0100/MATH0170/MATH0190). Additionally, assignments include the writing of simple Matlab code, so prior experience with Matlab may be beneficial.\nStudents were generally positive in their evaluation of Professor Lucien Bienenstock. They thought his demonstration of code/models was effective, but his explanations of mathematical concepts were sometimes too brief, disorganized, and confusing. His students greatly appreciated his availability outside of class and receptiveness to his students' needs.\nAssignments in \"Introduction to Computational Neuroscience\" included weekly homework assignments and one final exam. There was also a reading for each class. Students found that the weekly homework assignments varied in difficulty from easy to quite difficult depending on a student's prior experience with the topic. Class readings were relevant but were often very difficult to get through.\nOverall, students had mixed feelings about \"Introduction to Computational Neuroscience.\" Most students found the course very interesting and thought that the professor was passionate and knowledgeable about the topic. However, they thought that more of the material should have been explained in the course and that the course should have higher math prerequisites, as an understanding of many advanced topics is assumed. Those planning on taking this class should consider taking linear algebra and \"Ordinary Differential Equations\" (APMA0350) or \"Statistical Inference I\" (APMA1650) first.

Students suggested that while NEUR0010 was essential background for this course, the BIOL0200 requirement was not as necessary.\nStudents praised Professor Connors for his clear, focused, and organized lectures. Many students agreed that his lectures were \u201camazing,\u201d and one student remarked that his lectures made students want to \u201clisten to him all day and take copious notes.\u201d Professor Connors invited students to ask questions in class and was readily available outside of class. Several students also commented that the guest lecturers who came into class were also great.\nThis course\u2019s workload includes three midterms and one cumulative final exam, along with optional weekly readings. The midterms were all optional; however, if students did take all three midterms, they had the option of dropping their lowest exam score. Reviewers warned that the exams could be tricky or ambiguously worded and that Professor Connors expected students to remember details from lecture on the exams. Students agreed that most of the readings were dense and unnecessary and suggested that the lectures alone are sufficient to do well in this course.\nStudents spent an average of three hours per week on this course, which increased around exam time to about eight. Some reviewers suggested that, due to the technical material covered in this course, others should only take it if they were interested in the technical material covered in NEUR0010 or if it fulfills a concentration requirement.

The course has no official or unofficial prerequisites according to respondents, some of whom already had a philosophy background, and others of whom had backgrounds in mathematics or writing.\nStudents had high praise for Professor David Christensen, the primary lecturer. He was described as welcoming, \u201cquick on his feet\u201d, and an effective speaker. During lectures, he walked through reading assignments and led discussions on them, pausing to write key concepts on the board. Respondents felt comfortable expressing disagreement during discussions, and they felt the content of these discussions was highly applicable to assignments.\nFor this course, students were assigned readings that typically took about one hour per week. Some class members found the readings hard to follow, but one or more entire lectures were dedicated to each reading. The readings led to four papers, about 1500 words each, on one of the course\u2019s four main issues. Reviewers found the papers manageable but thought-provoking. Because the course is writing-designated, students were allowed to revise and resubmit the first paper for a higher grade. Later papers were given more weight than earlier ones, and attendance also factored into the grade, which used a letter system different from the standard Brown grading system.\nStudents who took PHIL0010 found that it challenged their way of thinking. Some reviewers even suggested the course to those who have already taken higher-level philosophy courses, while others suggested it may be best-suited for new philosophy students.\n\ninstructor: Instructors\nDavid Christensen\ndavid_christensen@brown.edu\n\nschedule: Schedule and Location\nMWF 11am-11:50am in Kassar House FOX\n\nprograms: Curricular Programs\nWriting - Designated Courses (WRIT)\n\naverage_hours: 3.23\n\nmax_hours: 8.09\n\ncourse_rating: 67%\n4.13\n\nprofessor_rating: 89%\n4.72\n\nprofessor_and_term: PHIL 0010 | Christensen, David (S1) | Spring 2023\n\n", "code: PHIL 0024\n\nterm: Spring 2025\n\ntitle: Philosophy of AI\n\ndescription: Recent breakthroughs in artificial intelligence have already begun to reshape our world, raising a host of new practical and theoretical challenges.

Billions live under it; arguably, the majority of us do, and even those who do not are affected by it. Yet many wish we did not. Historically, the greatest opposition has come from those who have described themselves as socialists. While socialism underwent a loss of popularity in the latter part of the 20th century and the beginning of the 21st due to the failures of self-described socialist regimes, it appears to be regaining popularity, at least among younger generations. But which is in fact better: capitalism or socialism? The question can still provoke heated debate. In this course, we will explore the ethical arguments for and against these economic systems, as well as ethical questions that each system raises.

Reviewers reported having previously taken introductory philosophy courses and introductory English courses, and possessing a general interest in philosophy, but seemed adamant that anyone willing to do the work can do well in the course.\nThe course itself was based heavily on lectures accompanied by PowerPoint slides, but the instructor did not shy away from in-class discussion in addition to the already scheduled class discussions. One reviewer mentioned that the class pace could be a bit quick at times, but this was not an overwhelming issue. The instructor was responsive to emails, provided valuable feedback on assignments, was available both in and out of class, and accommodated students needs.\nThe assignments consisted of several readings, three short papers, a midterm, and a final paper. While there was some disagreement about the difficulty of the assignments, all the assignments were described as highly relevant albeit dense at times.\nThe most memorable and noteworthy bits of this class included the small class size as well as the fact that the class provided a new perspective on the concept of fiction and what it means for something to be regarded as fiction. Students wished that the discussion prompts had been more detailed and open ended, and also noted that lecture could have been more engaging to keep the energy up in class.

Major course content covers literature from Descartes to Kant, but the focus of the course is placed on approaching philosophical reading and writing. Some students reported that a basic background in philosophy was useful to understand lectures, but most respondents said that students with no particular prior knowledge could excel in this course.\nIn terms of instruction, Professor Justin Broackes\u2019 enthusiasm for the course content was frequently praised by students. Many respondents reported that his \u201cmodern day examples\u201d and \u201cclear language\u201d helped them thoroughly understand philosophical concepts. While Professor Broackes did divert to tangents occasionally, students found these as a useful way to keep online lectures interesting. However, some students mentioned that the usage of visual aids (e.g. slides) would have helped clarify lectures.\nThe coursework for PHIL0360 included weekly readings, five short papers, one midterm paper, and one final exam. Respondents emphasized that the readings could get overwhelming at times. A majority of the feedback for PHIL0360 recommended future class members to stay on pace with the assigned readings. Additionally, former students noted that although the readings could be straight-forward, they often needed some time to digest. Average time commitment for the course ranged anywhere from two to nine hours per week.\nOverall, students were pleased with PHIL0360 as a fun introduction to the philosophy concentration. Professor Broackes\u2019s passion for the class and his well-made lectures helped students grasp the philosophical theories discussed in class. Students mentioned the usefulness of office hours and TAs in providing tips and answers for questions that came up in classes. Overall, PHIL0360 was recommended as a \u201cgood class to start with philosophy.\u201d\n\ninstructor: Instructors\nJustin Broackes\njustin_broackes@brown.edu\n\nschedule: Schedule and Location\nMWF 11am-11:50am Location TBD\n\nprograms: Curricular Programs\nWriting - Designated Courses (WRIT)\n\naverage_hours: 4.77\n\nmax_hours: 10.09\n\ncourse_rating: 45%\n3.92\n\nprofessor_rating: 48%\n4.15\n\nprofessor_and_term: PHIL 0360 | Broackes, Justin (S1) | Spring 2021\n\n", "code: PHIL 0295\n\nterm: Summer 2024\n\ntitle: Logic\n\ndescription: This course is an introduction to deductive logic.

The course initially focuses on game theory and then delves more into philosophy and politics. This small class combines both clearly focused lectures and deep discussion for a truly engaging course. Respondents indicated that no prerequisites were necessary and that an interest in the material was enough to do well.\nStudents described Professor Ryan Doody as \u201ca truly extraordinary professor\u201d who possesses a real passion for the material. With well-thought-out lectures and PowerPoints, students found the material easy to follow and incredibly clear. He also incorporated lots of activities and discussions into class time, and most students found the classes to be very engaging. While most enjoyed Professor Doody\u2019s inclusion of student ideas and willingness to answer questions quite helpful, some felt that additional questions were required for him to go more into depth.\nEach class began with a bit of review which students thought effectively reinforced concepts and permitted connections to new material. The course consisted of readings for each class accompanied by a weekly discussion post graded on completion. Students felt the variety of \u201creadings\u201d from podcasts to news articles and even online games created enjoyable variety. Respondents also emphasized that the readings were not all \"old philosophers\" as they often engaged with contemporary sources. Weekly, there were one to two open note take-home quizzes from that week\u2019s material. Both the midterm and final were take-home exams and consisted of multiple-choice, short answer, and essay components that were described as not overly difficult.\nStudents highly recommended this course for its fascinating material and charismatic professor. With the work never feeling like a chore, some even felt it was their favorite class at Brown. Students appreciated the breadth of the course and its applicability to the world today, providing a solid background for many other classes. Professor Doody\u2019s own views did not influence what he taught as he always sure to show both sides to the material.

It is designed as an introductory class, and most students agreed that no background knowledge is needed to enjoy the course material.\nProfessor David Estlund was described as a clear, effective, and passionate instructor, who explained ideas with a whiteboard rather than lecture slides. Many respondents admired the well-organized lecture notes released after each class, and they thought that the notes helped them enormously for writing papers and preparing for the weekly discussions. Most mentioned that Professor Estlund encouraged students to ask questions in the classroom and was extremely helpful during office hours. Some student thought the TAs were also very dedicated and responsive to student needs.\nThe course assignments consisted of reading reports, thinking pieces, and four papers. There is no midterm or final exam. Most students thought the readings were lengthy but relevant to the lectures. The reading reports and thinking pieces were described as time-consuming, but many thought they did not add too much stress as they were graded on completion. Most students appreciated the paper topics and described them as challenging yet manageable with plenty of help from Professor Estlund and the TAs.\nOverall, students enjoyed this course for the comprehensive and interesting topics presented by Professor Estlund. Many respondents thought the Friday discussion section was facilitated very well and was \"the highlight of the course.\" For future improvements, students suggested condensing some lengthy readings and adding more group discussion sections. For those interested in this course, many recommended this class to any STEM student who is looking for an introductory philosophy class.

Students praised him as being incredibly knowledgeable and passionate about the material. Reviewers thought Professor Schechter was a witty and dynamic lecturer, but very repetitive. Many respondents described the lectures as clear and organized, but others had trouble following them.\nAssignments for the course consisted of weekly problem sets, optional readings, a midterm exam, and a final exam. Many respondents found the homework assignments to be difficult and time-consuming, but necessary for understanding the material. While the homework assignments were not curved, even when the class did poorly, the professor offered opportunities for extra credit. Students noted that going to TA office hours was helpful. The exams were timed, and students found them difficult to complete in one hour. However, some considered the exam questions easier than the homework problems.\nOverall, reviewers had mixed impressions of the difficulty of the course. Respondents cautioned future students that the course started slowly, but picked up in pace and difficulty over the semester. According to one student, while the course requires \u201cgrit and determination,\u201d it pays off in satisfaction.

Students stated that he was an excellent lecturer and highly encouraged discussion. Although he used PowerPoints as the basis of his lecture, students noted that his slides were missing details and suggested class attendance would be highly helpful. As the material could be rather intricate and difficult at times, Professor Pautz was more than willing to explain more basic concepts if students were confused.\nBeyond being a discussion-based class, the coursework consisted of weekly readings, a six-to-eight page midterm paper, a 12-16 page final paper, and an in-class presentation. Reviewers noted that the readings were generally relevant but could occasionally be rather dense. Additionally, one student suggested that there be shorter assignments to supplement the two longer essays required in this course. Nevertheless, the students found the classwork to be highly manageable.\nOverall, students found Professor Pautz to be an excellent instructor.

Given the objectionable nature of the intentional imposition of harm, a failure to adequately justify the practice can call into question its persistence. For democratic societies in particular, the question of whether punishment can be adequately justified is of special concern. This course will survey the major philosophical justifications for legal punishment. Special focus will be placed on the expressive dimensions of punishment, the punishment of adolescent offenders and the possibility of their incarceration with adults, as well as arguments for and against the abolition of incarceration as a form of punishment.\n\ninstructor: Instructors\nBreond Durr\nbreond_durr@brown.edu\n\nschedule: Schedule and Location\nTTh 2:30pm-3:50pm in 45 Prospect St-CorlissBrackett 106\n\ncritical_review_url: http://www.thecriticalreview.org/PHIL/1005\n\n", "code: PHIL 1012\n\nterm: Spring 2025\n\ntitle: Climate Ethics\n\ndescription: Climate change challenges our way of life and our institutions. The impact of climate change is not the same all over the globe. Developing countries may suffer worse consequences than wealthier countries. At the same time wealthier countries are responsible for most of the greenhouse gas emissions. Maybe we can mitigate or adapt to climate change, but the question whether we should do something about climate change is an ethical question. The ethical question is complex. Who is morally responsible for climate change? Individuals? States and nations? Can past generations be held responsible for their greenhouse gas emissions? Do we have moral obligations toward future generations? Should all countries bear the burden of climate change equally?\n\ninstructor: Instructors\nAnna Bjurman Pautz\nanna_pautz@brown.edu\n\nschedule: Schedule and Location\nTTh 10:30am-11:50am Location TBD\n\nprograms: Curricular Programs\nWriting - Designated Courses (WRIT)\n\ncritical_review_url: http://www.thecriticalreview.org/PHIL/1012\n\n", "code: PHIL 1135\n\nterm: Fall 2024\n\ntitle: First Philosophy in Aristotle (Metaphysics)\n\ndescription: A close study of Aristotle\u2019s Metaphysics, which he called First Philosophy and contrasts with the natural sciences, and culminates in his theology.

We examine classic theories of well-being: hedonistic, desire, and eudaimonistic theories, as well as new theoretical options (internalist and constitutivist theories).

Students gain an understanding of systems of formal proof. The course focuses on the philosophical theorems related to propositional and first-order logic. The professor stresses that this is essentially a math course. While there were no official pre-requisites for the class, reviewers thought that a background in proof-based math, discrete structure and/or logic was very helpful like CSCI0220, MATH1530, and CSCI1010. Many suggested having taken PHIL0540 before this.\nAll students found the professor to be great and \"awesome\". He was very passionate about his teaching. His lecture style was very effective for most students. He was very intelligent and did not stop students from asking questions but rather encouraged it. He always came into class with an organized lesson plan. His lectures were often engaging. Some students did feel that the professor was sometimes too fast and too smart to catch up to what he was saying sometimes. But his accessibility made up for it and he was very available outside class during office hours.\nThe course assignments included optional but recommended workshops, six problem sets in total which were assigned biweekly, and one final problem which was twice as long as the other problem sets. All the assignments varied in difficulty but, most students felt it was worthwhile and satisfying. Even though the assignments were hard, the grading was not harsh. Some felt it was sometimes too hard towards the end but was still applicable to the course's goals. The students also enjoyed good discussions at the end of the semester.\nOverall students found the lectures very engaging and found the professor to be very effective. Although some students would've liked to see more documentation/resources for definitions etc, most students found his hours enough. Some students felt that the course could benefit from more material to be covered, and more workshops to be held.\n\ninstructor: Instructors\nEric Guindon\neric_guindon@brown.edu\n\nschedule: Schedule and Location\nMWF 10am-10:50am in 101 Thayer Street (VGQ 1st fl) 116B\n\naverage_hours: 4.69\n\nmax_hours: 9.67\n\ncourse_rating: 41%\n4.33\n\nprofessor_rating: 63%\n4.77\n\nprofessor_and_term: PHIL 1630 | Guindon, Eric (S1) | Fall 2019\n\n", "code: PHIL 1735\n\nterm: Spring 2025\n\ntitle: Metaphysics\n\ndescription: A survey of some major topics in metaphysics, with a particular focus on radical metaphysical arguments \u2013 arguments that call into question our most basic beliefs about the world.

Topics covered include mind and behavior, thought and language, and intentionality and consciousness. The only prerequisite for the course is any one philosophy course, although more are preferred. Students stated that backgrounds in logic, neuroscience, and philosophy were helpful but not necessary for success, stressing the course\u2019s accessibility to anyone with a strong interest in the functioning of the mind.\nStudents praised Professor Adam Pautz\u2019s sense of humor and precise, engaging lectures. Professor Pautz lectured with PowerPoint slides, while keeping classes conversational and question-driven with substantial discussions. Students enjoyed the variety of viewpoints that were covered, finding many topics \u201cfascinating.\u201d In particular, respondents found the balance between questions, discussions, and lecturing \u201cideal for learning and intellectual discourse.\u201d Professor Pautz held regular office hours, and students found him to be very available and his feedback to be helpful.\nAssignments for the course consisted of weekly readings, one paper, a midterm, and a final exam. Students felt that readings were dense at times, but otherwise interesting and relevant. The assignments were challenging, but rewarding and interesting, according to students. However, a few students mentioned that a practice writing assignment before the final paper would have aided students who did not have as much experience writing philosophy papers.\nOverall, students strongly recommended the course for its unique subject matter, balanced class structure, and \u201camazing\u201d professor. Most felt the course to be very accessible to non-concentrators, and they encouraged those interested in philosophy, neuroscience, and the mind to shop it.

Logically, students recommended that those who are interested in PHIL1850 first take basic logic in the form of PHIL0540: Though not officially required, the material learned in PHIL0540 was reportedly integral to understanding the more developed methods of logic in PHIL1850. Because of the aspects of PHIL1850 that involve proofs, one student wrote that \"lack of math phobia\" was a must.\nProfessor Schechter's teaching earned unmitigated praise. Some students recognized the potential for the material to be unclear and overly technical. In spite of these challenges, students reported that Professor Schechter presented all of the course's concepts in a \"particularly clear, easy-to-grasp manner.\" Students valued his helpful tendency to pause to check on whether students were following what was being taught; this interest in students' learning was reinforced by responsive email communications and a willingness to meet with students to help them with the material. His teaching style was described as \"dynamic\" and his methods as effective.\nUnderstanding of the material was developed through 11 problem sets, six of which were graded; the rest were effectively optional. These problem sets were considered the ideal way to better understand the content of PHIL1850. There were two assessments: a midterm and a final, both of which were reportedly fair.\nDuring most weeks, students spent just several hours on work for the course outside of class; this peaked near 10 hours during unusually demanding weeks. Students warned that this class should be taken only if you come in with a well-informed interest in logic. Shopping other logic classes in the department was also recommended, if PHIL1850 turns out not to be your thing. But if the class is right for you, students promised strong teaching and therefore lots of learning.\n\ninstructor: Instructors\nRichard Kimberly Heck\nrichard_heck@brown.edu\n\nschedule: Schedule and Location\nMWF 12pm-12:50pm in Andrews House 310\n\naverage_hours: 4.43\n\nmax_hours: 9.69\n\ncourse_rating: 57%\n4.25\n\nprofessor_rating: 74%\n4.61\n\nprofessor_and_term: PHIL 1850 | Schechter, Joshua (S1) | Spring 2011\n\n", "code: PHIL 2000\n\nterm: Fall 2024\n\ntitle: Graduate Proseminar\n\ndescription: Will cover classics of philosophy from the end of the 19th century to the end of the 20th; including ethics as well as metaphysics, epistemology and philosophy of language.\n\ninstructor: Instructors\nJoshua Schechter\njoshua_schechter@brown.edu\n\nschedule: Schedule and Location\nMWF 8am-8:50am in 45 Prospect St-CorlissBrackett 106\n\ncritical_review_url: http://www.thecriticalreview.org/PHIL/2000\n\n", "code: PHIL 2010\n\nterm: Spring 2025\n\ntitle: Third Year Workshop\n\ndescription: No description available.\n\ninstructor: Instructors\nAdam Pautz\nadam_pautz@brown.edu\n\nschedule: Schedule and Location\nM 3pm-5:30pm Location TBD\n\ncritical_review_url: http://www.thecriticalreview.org/PHIL/2010\n\n", "code: PHIL 2020\n\nterm: Fall 2024\n\ntitle: Dissertation Workshop\n\ndescription: Course for graduate students during their 4th year or above.\n\ninstructor: Instructors\nJames Dreier\njames_dreier@brown.edu\n\nschedule: Schedule and Location\nMWF 9am-9:50am in 45 Prospect St-CorlissBrackett 106\n\ncritical_review_url: http://www.thecriticalreview.org/PHIL/2020\n\n", "code: PHIL 2061\n\nterm: Spring 2025\n\ntitle: Intentionality: Beliefs, Concepts, and Linguistic Meanings\n\ndescription: Intentionality is a property possessed by mental entities that are about, directed on, or represent things other than themselves.

This seminar is organized around the work of Chisholm, but it is not just about him. Chisholm had distinctive positions on most of the major topics in epistemology, metaphysics, and the philosophy of mind, positions that were subsequently built upon or challenged by others. Tracing his views and the responses to them can thus serve as something of a history of metaphysics and epistemology over a 50-year period, leading up to contemporary debates and providing background for them.

There are no official prerequisites, and students overwhelmingly agreed that no background knowledge or experience is required for success in the course. However, some students did note that other PHP courses, such as \u201cIntroduction to Public Health\u201d (PHP0320), and general public health knowledge did provide them with useful background.\nProfessor Ira Wilson was praised for his lecture-based teaching methods. Students unanimously agreed that Dr. Wilson\u2019s lectures were extremely passionate, organized, and effective at teaching complex concepts. Respondents noted that the lectures could be fast-paced sometimes, but Professor Wilson\u2019s extensive use of \u201ctake home message\u201d slides helped students cut through the necessary details. The course also had numerous guest speakers and lecturers throughout the semester, however, students felt that these lecturers varied in teaching ability and occasionally disrupted the overall consistency of the course.\nAssignments for this course included readings and reading quizzes. There were also section meetings throughout the semester, which had their own assignments as well. There were also two non-cumulative in-person midterms and a cumulative final exam during the semester. Prospective students are advised to stay on top of their reading quizzes, as these are extremely representative of the midterms and final exams. Respondents also noted that sometimes the textbook readings go too far in detail, but studying what is presented in the lecture should be more than enough.\nOverall, students highly recommended that others take this course, regardless of their intended concentration. It was described as an informative course that opens new perspectives, with one student describing it as \u201ca great class for everyone, regardless of background and interest\u201d since it teaches the \u201cessentials for the common person to be aware of.\"\n\ninstructor: Instructors\nIra Wilson\nira_wilson@brown.edu\nCara Sammartino\ncara_sammartino@brown.edu\n\nschedule: Schedule and Location\nMWF 10am-10:50am in Salomon Center DECI\n\naverage_hours: 3.22\n\nmax_hours: 7.07\n\ncourse_rating: 57%\n4.27\n\nprofessor_rating: 74%\n4.60\n\nprofessor_and_term: PHP 0310 | Wilson, Ira (S1) | Fall 2023\n\n", "code: PHP 0320\n\nterm: Spring 2025\n\ntitle: Introduction to Public Health\n\ndescription: \u201cIntroduction to Public Health\u201d (PHP0320) is meant to provide students with an introduction to aspects of the United States public health system such as the benefits and challenges of working with communities and how populations are affected by certain health issues. The course has no prerequisite requirements.\nProfessor Michael Barton Laws primarily used lecture slides during class and sometimes invited guest lecturers to speak about relevant topics. Students praised Professor Laws and the class TAs for their availability outside of class but wished that grading was more efficient and timely. In addition, reviewers praised Professor Laws for his PowerPoint slides and his knowledge of the material; however, some found that at times, lectures had too much information and were not engaging enough. Professor Laws always made lecture slides and lecture capture available to students which helped them review material following the class.\nStudents noted that class assignments consisted of readings, weekly section assignments, two papers, and two essays. Most respondents did not find these assignments difficult, but many noted that some assignments could be time consuming. Regardless, students appreciated that the assignments were always relevant and covered interesting topics. One reviewer said they enjoyed watching a John Oliver video discussing a relevant social justice issue.\nIn order to improve the course for the future, reviewers thought grading should become more timely and lectures should be more concise and paced better.

The course considers how such policies that aim to reduce disease burden and health disparities intersect with broader ethical questions about personal freedoms. There is one prerequisite, \u201cIntroduction to Public Health\u201d (PHP0320), which may be taken concurrently. Some respondents also recommended that \u201cHealth Care in the United States\u201d (PHP0310) be taken first.\nProfessor Fulton was praised for his jovial personality, knowledge, and careful handling of the course\u2019s more serious topics, all of which prevented monotony during long lectures. He included plenty of captivating anecdotes in these lectures, which respondents viewed with mixed attitudes. In particular, although classmates\u2019 questions were always welcomed wholeheartedly, several reviewers wished for opportunities to discuss lecture topics in order to add more variety during 80-minute class periods.\nStudents were expected to complete one take-home quiz, one midterm, and one final, as well as weekly writing assignments that built up toward a research policy brief. Additionally, there were optional article and textbook readings that many students did not find important. The writing assignments were widely considered the most useful component of PHP0330, as multiple class members described learning while writing each section of their policy briefs and then feeling a sense of achievement at their synthesis into a final product.\nOverall, PHP0330 was regarded as rewarding and worthwhile for public health and public policy concentrators. Students believed the course\u2019s final project in particular was a valuable experience for their future studies, and they enjoyed Professor Fulton\u2019s passionate lecture style.

Her slides provided information in a comprehensive way, and she additionally provided lecture notes and reading materials prior to class as well as discussion board topics that helped students solidify their understanding of the concepts taught in class. She additionally used case studies to help students understand material. However, some students wished that Professor Lee had focused more on connecting the various topics back to the core theoretical or applied focus idea and introducing the analytical settings where each method would be used in practice.\nAssignments included weekly readings, a few discussion posts, five problem sets, a final exam, and a final project that involved the critique of a publication. Students noted that assignments, especially the problem sets, were very helpful to helping them understand course content as they contained a combination of problem types. However, one student noted their dissatisfaction with the weighting of problem sets and the quick turnaround time for the assignments.\nOverall, students thought this course to be a solid overview of causal inference, especially with its blend of theory and practical application. However, students should expect to put in a lot of work to understand the concepts, especially because the subject matter is quite difficult.\n\ninstructor: Instructors\nYoujin Lee\nyoujin_lee@brown.edu\n\nschedule: Schedule and Location\nTTh 9am-10:20am in 121 South Main Street 241\n\naverage_hours: 9.81\n\nmax_hours: 18.31\n\ncourse_rating: 39%\n4.14\n\nprofessor_rating: 60%\n4.52\n\nprofessor_and_term: PHP 2610 | Lee, Youjin (S1) | Fall 2022\n\n", "code: PHP 2690A\n\nterm: Fall 2024\n\ntitle: Statistical Methods for Design and Analysis of Randomized Trials\n\ndescription: Modern account of methods for the design and analysis of trials in health research, with emphasis on randomized studies.

This mandatory S/NC course serves as an introductory course for students intending to concentrate in physics. Prerequisites include high school calculus and physics. Students noted that AP Physics 1 and 2, AP Physics C, and AP Calculus BC knowledge were very helpful throughout the course.\nIt was clear that Professor Ian Dell\u2019Antonio was passionate about the course, but students were mixed on the effectiveness of his teaching methods. He used slides and provided demonstrations during lecture, but students reported that he spent a lot of time going on tangents or deriving equations that weren\u2019t seen again. Respondents noted that lectures could be hard to follow due to the professor skipping steps while solving the problems. On the other hand, some students found his lectures helpful if they took notes and reviewed the concepts. Students appreciated that Professor Dell'Antonio was helpful in office hours, answering questions about the problem sets.\nAssignments included nine weekly problem sets, pre-lecture readings and corresponding quizzes, five scaffolded problems, and one final project. There were two midterm exams and one final exam, but if you had already reached the 300 points required to pass the course, then you were not required to take the final. Problem sets were said to be challenging and time consuming, but interesting to solve. Scaffolded problems were slightly longer and more complicated than the problem set problems. Students did note that assignments were not always uploaded to Canvas, which was frustrating.\nOverall, this course is very difficult and mathematically rigorous.

How can we think, do, create, perform, listen, sense, perceive, and generate future-oriented imaginaries based on the texture of ancient ways? This collaborative humanities course centers perspectives, translations, and mediations from and about the Am\u00e9ricas. We seek to decenter the liberal humanism of environmental thinking to present modes of being that emerge from the otherwise of the Am\u00e9ricas. This imaginary is pluralistic in its linguistic, racial, ethnic, and gendered imagination. It foregrounds submerged perspectives and unearths subterranean stories that confront legacies of (neo)colonialism, racial capitalism, and extractivist exploitation.

Nonetheless, Sousa Santos observes that this hegemony is challenged by a reality of widespread human rights abuses. What then, is the value of human rights and what role does literature play in the discursive construction and the praxis of human rights?

Although no official prerequisites are required, respondents stated that prior political science coursework in college and high school was helpful.\nStudents praised Professor Arenberg for his passion and experience with the subject. Respondents appreciated that he often mentioned current events during lectures. Some students noted that the course was lecture-heavy and could sometimes be dry, varying in how engaging they were.\nWork for the course included weekly readings, weekly Canvas responses, quizzes, papers, and in-class exams. Some students noted that \u201ccontent was mostly learned through the textbook and not lectures\u201d and also noted that the quizzes felt more like assignments than actual quizzes. Respondents stated that if students kept up with the readings and attended lectures, the tests were not that difficult.\nOverall, students thought that POLS0010 was a good introduction to the field of political science.

Students read the works of some of history\u2019s greatest political thinkers, from Hobbes to Plato to Rousseau. As an introductory political science course, POLS0110 has no required prerequisites, but reviewers found past philosophy, political science, and history courses to be useful background.\nStudents described Professor Gourevitch as a passionate lecturer who \u201cknows what he\u2019s talking about.\u201d Some found his lectures to be quite fast-paced but added that lectures were very effective at illuminating difficult material from the readings. Responders also mentioned that Professor Gourevitch was always willing to stay after class to talk to students and answer questions. POLS0110 also includes weekly discussion sections led by TAs. The TAs had weekly office hours and did all of the grading for this course.\nAssignments for POLS0110 included three papers, weekly readings, and a take-home final exam. Each consecutive paper was longer and counted for a higher percentage of the final grade. Students said the weekly readings were very long and ranged from \u201crelatively understandable\u201d to \u201cdifficult to comprehend.\u201d Reviewers found the papers to be reasonably challenging but said the final exam was rather difficult. The exam included a quote-identification portion, which students felt unprepared for. Besides the exam, students felt most of the coursework was quite relevant.\nOverall, students felt they highly benefited from Professor Gourevitch\u2019s engaging lectures. They did feel, however, that readings could have been shorter or fewer in number. Respondents also wished that the take-home final exam had been simpler. Reviewers highly suggested that future students of POLS0110 do their best to always keep up with the readings.

It also introduces various modes of analysis in comparative politics. According to the course description, cases will be drawn from \u201cWestern and Eastern Europe, Asia, Africa, the Middle East, and Latin America.\u201d Most respondents did not have background in the field, with a few having taken \u201cIntroduction to International Politics\u201d (POLS0400) before.\nProfessor Steinfeld received very positive feedback on his passion for the material and his encouragement of classroom participation. Even though he delivered lectures, students agreed that the course showed huge emphasis on discussion. More than half of the reviewers, however, pointed out that Professor Steinfeld did not use any slides to accompany his lectures, making them hard to follow. Some students also noted that the lectures were sometimes unstructured and disorganized. Respondents who interacted with Professor Steinfeld outside of class described him as very open and available.\nAssignments consisted of one midterm paper (an argument critique), one 13-15 page final paper (take-home final), two argument mapping exercises, and several articles to read per week. Students reported that the writing assignments were not hard but required \u201ccareful thought and reading,\u201d and that they clearly lacked guidance. Opinions on the readings were divided: some students found them relevant to course goals, whereas others considered them disconnected from lecture.\n\u201cIntroduction to Comparative Politics\u201d received mixed feedback on the material and assignments, with one reviewer saying that \u201cit isn\u2019t a traditional comparative politics class.\u201d Nonetheless, students agreed that Professor Steinfeld was helpful throughout the course.

Although there were no official prerequisites for this introductory course, basic world history and current events knowledge, in addition to strong writing skills, were found to be helpful.\nStudents complimented Professor Maher\u2019s well-structured and straightforward lectures, effective outlining of topics, and emphasis of main points and ideas, but they generally found him to be an unenthusiastic, and \u201cdetached\u201d lecturer. He tended to read off his slides and would often become monotonous towards the end of lectures. Noting that Professor Maher was a first-time professor, however, students praised his efforts and agreed that lectures improved as the semester progressed. They also found his lecture slides, although at times a bit wordy, to be extremely helpful, and appreciated that they were posted to MyCourses.\nThe assigned readings, although they could be long and dense, were seen as informative and enriching, reinforcing concepts taught in lectures and presenting a variety of viewpoints on each topic. Some students wished that more current events articles were included in place of sometimes repetitive older works, but all cautioned that it was vital to keep up with the large amount of reading. In addition to weekly readings, the workload consisted of three 1500 word papers, a midterm, a non-cumulative final exam, and section participation. Students noted that this seemed like a large amount of reading and written work for an introductory course.\nStudents generally spent around 3 to 5 hours per week on this course, with the figure doubling to around eight when papers were due and prior to the exams. Students were mixed in their recommendation of this course, with some citing it as an intensive overview of an interesting and applicable field, and others cautioning that the material can be lackluster without a strong interest in the subject.

The class combines facets of lecture-based instruction and discussion-based discourse. There are no prerequisites for this course, but enrollment is limited to students in their sophomore year and beyond, and former students noted that having some background in political science could be helpful for engagement in the course.\nStudents appreciated Professor Rebecca Weitz-Shapiro\u2019s \u201cno-nonsense\u201d approach to teaching the material. Class members also appreciated her encouragement of audience participation and questions throughout the lectures. Respondents also praised Professor Weitz-Shapiro for getting to know her students, which aided in her direct delivery of information and in facilitating deeper discussions.\nCoursework for this class included weekly assigned readings, a quiz, a paper, an in-class exam, and one group project. Respondents noted that it is necessary for future students to keep up with the assigned readings, as background and information provided by the readings are essential for fruitful participation in the twenty to thirty minute long discussions that took place at the end of each lecture.\nOverall, students regarded \u201cFoundations of Political Analysis\u201d as a technical yet highly rewarding course. Students advise having a background in statistics and political science to get the most out of the class. Many found Professor Weitz-Shapiro\u2019s organization and straightforward delivery well suited for the course\u2019s material.

The course has no prerequisites and satisfies the gateway requirement for an IAPA concentration.\nProfessor Peter Andreas received generally favorable reviews from students, who described him as a passionate and engaging lecturer. However, the organization of his lectures was a frequent point of criticism, as lectures were delivered without slides. Laptops were also not allowed in class without previously approved accommodations, which some class members deemed an additional challenge for organizing lecture notes. Students responded more positively to the guest lecturers brought into class throughout the semester, who were described as \u201cextremely qualified and passionate.\u201d\nCoursework for POLS1020 included weekly readings, three in-class exams, and weekly attendance and participation in course sections. Multiple respondents noted that the class had extensive readings, and that keeping up with the readings was imperative for success on exams. Students offered mixed reviews on course materials; while some found the content to be interesting and in-depth, others found the readings dense and overwhelming. A few reviewers also said that exam grading was somewhat subjective or unclear, and that exams required an excessive amount of memorization from the readings.\nOverall, students had a relatively positive experience in POLS1020, thanks to the engaging lecturing of Professor Andreas and various guest speakers.

Students generally felt that only a cursory reading of the textbooks was necessary to succeed, and the lectures were otherwise sufficient. The paper was originally planned to be 15 pages long, but this was shortened to 10 pages, and the exams were 2,400 words in length, with two weeks to work on each one. Attendance counted for 10% of the grade.\nOverall, reviewers considered POLS1100 a valuable course with a broad scope. They appreciated learning about the \u201cprocedural quirks of Congress in-depth\u201d and felt more informed politically as a result. Those interested in an even broader approach to U.S. politics might consider \u201cIntroduction to the American Political Process\u201d (POLS0010).\n\ninstructor: Instructors\nRichard Arenberg\nrichard_arenberg@brown.edu\n\nschedule: Schedule and Location\nMWF 1pm-1:50pm Location TBD\n\naverage_hours: 2.33\n\nmax_hours: 6.70\n\ncourse_rating: 56%\n4.19\n\nprofessor_rating: 65%\n4.83\n\nprofessor_and_term: POLS 1100 | Arenberg, Richard (S1) | Spring 2023\n\n", "code: POLS 1120\n\nterm: Fall 2024\n\ntitle: Campaigns and Elections\n\ndescription: In Professor Arenberg\u2019s \u201cCampaigns and Elections\u201d (POLS1120), students engage in both historical and contemporary elections at the presidential, congressional, state and local levels, with an emphasis on practical lessons from recent elections. While a general knowledge of American electoral politics is useful, most reviewers claimed that no particular coursework is needed to fully appreciate this class.\nThe centerpiece of \u201cCampaigns and Elections\u201d is Arenberg\u2019s notorious lectures, characterized by frequent \u201cwar stories\u201d taken from Arenberg\u2019s long tenure on Capitol Hill. Students broadly reviewed this course as pragmatic rather than theoretical, as course content drew much more from Arenberg\u2019s 34 years in Washington (including senior staff positions with Senate Majority Leaders) than from the textbooks. A particular favorite for some students was the daily episode of \u201cThis Week in Washington,\u201d which covered recent ongoings on Capitol Hill. While most students expressed positive feelings about the lectures, a minority criticized them for their dryness and over-reliance on prepared slides.\nStudents generally put the course\u2019s total workload on the lighter side. While there are weekly assigned readings (around a chapter per class), these readings were described by reviewers as being supplementary, as they are not always directly referenced in class lectures. A single 15-page paper and the two take-home exams (around ten pages) each make up thirty percent of the grade, with participation making up the final ten percent. Reviewers found these papers to be reasonable and not nearly as bad as they initially sound. In total, the average time spent outside of class was around two hours a week.\nSatisfaction in \u201cCampaigns and Elections\u201d largely hinges on a personal preference for \u201cwar stories.\u201d If you prefer longer personalized lectures over drier textbook theory, this is the course for you. As one reviewer succinctly put it, \u201cif you want to read 200 pages and have surface-level arguments with other people who skimmed 200 pages, don\u2019t take this class. If you want to go in [and] listen to this guy talk about his time on Capitol Hill for 50 minutes\u2026 this is your class.\u201d\n\ninstructor: Instructors\nRichard Arenberg\nrichard_arenberg@brown.edu\n\nschedule: Schedule and Location\nTTh 1pm-2:20pm in Smith-Buonanno Hall 106\n\naverage_hours: 2.08\n\nmax_hours: 7.83\n\ncourse_rating: 52%\n3.92\n\nprofessor_rating: 71%\n4.47\n\nprofessor_and_term: POLS 1120 | Arenberg, Richard (S1) | Fall 2022\n\n", "code: POLS 1130\n\nterm: Spring 2025\n\ntitle: The American Presidency\n\ndescription: \u201cThe American Presidency\u201d (POLS1130) analyzes the office of the presidency as well as presidential history with a focus on American presidents from FDR to Trump. There are no formal prerequisites though reviewers found previous high school government and politics courses to be helpful. Reviewers noted that the most useful prerequisite for the class was watching the news, as the course addressed present political issues.\nProfessor Richard Arenberg was beloved by students who overwhelmingly could not wait to take more courses with him. Each class began with a \u201cThis Week in Washington\u201d portion to analyze the news and keep students informed. Class structure consisted of lectures with powerpoint slides though reviewers noted that Professor Arenberg was incredibly open to questions and tried to encourage discussion whenever possible. Professor Arenberg would occasionally deviate from the slides to tell stories from his decades of experience on Capitol Hill.\nAssignments included weekly readings, two take-home exams, and one 15 page paper. Reviewers found the two exams to be fair and very relevant to course content. The take-home nature of the exams allowed reviewers to craft well-thought answers without frantic cramming. The 15-page paper required students to compare two modern presidents, which reviewers found to be long but informative. Overall reviewers fell that expectations were clear, grading was quick and transparent, and assignments were relevant.\nStudents found the course to be an excellent exploration into the office of the presidency and came away with plenty of new knowledge about specific presidencies. Reviewers encouraged prospective students to ask Professor Arenberg questions about his experience as his answers were always very interesting. Overall, students highly recommend the course as a great, peaceful way, to learn about our Presidency.\n\ninstructor: Instructors\nRichard Arenberg\nrichard_arenberg@brown.edu\n\nschedule: Schedule and Location\nMWF 2pm-2:50pm Location TBD\n\naverage_hours: 2.00\n\nmax_hours: 6.00\n\ncourse_rating: 38%\n4.04\n\nprofessor_rating: 61%\n4.61\n\nprofessor_and_term: POLS 1130 | Arenberg, Richard (S1) | Spring 2023\n\n", "code: POLS 1140\n\nterm: Fall 2024\n\ntitle: Public Opinion and American Democracy\n\ndescription: *Please note that this course was taught partially online \u2013 this review may not be reflective of future semesters*\n\"Public Opinion and American Democracy\" (POLS1140) explores public opinion and its measurement, and the potential policy implications of people\u2019s preferences. There are no formal prerequisites for this course, though many students found that having a background in statistics would have made parts of the course easier.\nRespondents found Professor Paul Testa to be an enthusiastic, passionate, and accommodating instructor who utilized well-organized presentations containing memes and other fun jokes to increase engagement. Students indicated that Professor Testa was highly passionate about the material, and made great efforts to ensure that students could have the best learning environment possible, which included great flexibility in the transition period during COVID-19.\nThe course consisted of various weekly readings, two term papers, three reading reflection papers, and a final group project. Students found the readings somewhat difficult and dry, but highly useful for class discussions. The term papers were very flexible in terms of the topics that course-takers could pursue. While a deep understanding of statistics was not necessary to do well in the class, it was certainly helpful in understanding the material better. One respondent, in particular, indicated that the course was heavy on the \u201cresearch\u201d component, which included going deeper into study methodology and the group project where students conducted their own research.\nAll students highly enjoyed the course and recommended others to shop it, citing Professor Testa\u2019s entertaining and passionate instruction as the chief reason. Students saw this course as helpful to their overall understanding of political science methods, and also found the material highly relevant to the current political landscape.

Beyond the obvious, the course goals are very murky; students' reviews seem to suggest that the ability to take good notes in lecture and learn to understand people who speak rapidly are both helpful. Useful prerequisites include Latin American history, comparative politics, and development theory, but none seemed to be crucial to comprehending the professor and the material.\nAn enthusiastic man, Professor Kenneth Shadlen gained the respect of his students. They admired his enthusiasm and his ability to explain the topic at hand. Despite these attributes, however, they felt lukewarm about taking another class of his, even if they all felt that they learned a lot from his teaching. Some students greatly loved the professor, however; of the extremes, most were on the side of adoration.\nThis class is a lecture-based Political Science course, meaning, of course, that a discussion section is expected. Students had little to say about the sections, suggesting they were generally not useful, but had much to say of the professor's assignments. Students felt that Shalden assigned many useful, intelligent and enjoyable readings, which required about seven to eight hours of reading per week. Shalden also required students to write two papers (which a minority of respondents described as 'take-home exams') and take an in-class midterm. Professor Shalden avoided using reading period, except to make-up one missed class from earlier in the semester.\nStudents found themselves glad to have taken the course, but as one respondent put it, 'Ask me after the final paper is done.' They would recommend the course to others, but add words of caution in doing so: interest in Latin American politics is a must-have, and homework is a must-do.\n\ninstructor: Instructors\nRichard Snyder\nrichard_snyder@brown.edu\n\nschedule: Schedule and Location\nMWF 2pm-2:50pm in Smith-Buonanno Hall G18\n\naverage_hours: N/A\n\nmax_hours: N/A\n\ncourse_rating: 40%\n4.32\n\nprofessor_rating: 41%\n4.40\n\nprofessor_and_term: POLS 1210 | Shadlen (S1) | Fall 1999\n\n", "code: POLS 1250\n\nterm: Spring 2025\n\ntitle: Capitalism, Democracy, and Geopolitics in Europe\n\ndescription: \"The Politics of European Democracies\" (POLS1250) offers students an exploration into the foundations of government in Europe, analyzing topics such as social movements, elections, and current events.

Additionally, students responded that the instructor was not as flexible and accommodating when it came to the COVID-19 transition. Most students also agreed that the readings could be more focused, as there was sometimes too much content that was not directly relevant to the class.\nOverall, students found the instructor to be very passionate about the material, and the course to be interesting.

Professor Rahul Mediratta's \"Contraband Capitalism: States and Illegal Global Markets\" (POLS1820H) investigates the clandestine economy, from illicit narcotics to the underground weapon trade. One of the instructor's main goals for this course was to provide students with the tools to evaluate key debates about illegal markets. Although there are no official prerequisites for this course, registration is limited to 20 juniors and seniors specifically concentrating in Development Studies, Political Science, or International Relations. In addition, students who have already taken \"Politics of the Illicit Global Economy\" (POLS1020) cannot take this course. Many reviewers agreed that a background in political science, economics, and international relations courses was very beneficial.\nMost students agreed that Professor Mediratta was readily available in office hours and over email. Reviewers also appreciated his tendency to provide extensive feedback and to encourage participation through a free-flowing, flexible, and discussion-based learning environment. A few students wished that the professor had implemented more structure, but the majority of the class favored his hands-off approach.\nAssignments for this writing-designated (WRIT) course included weekly readings, two four- to six-page reading response papers and accompanying presentations, and a final research capstone paper. A few reviewers noted that the grading process was a bit unclear, since they were allowed to address readings in any way they chose. Most would have liked a straightforward outline of expectations for each assignment. However, almost every respondent agreed that the assignments were both captivating and relevant to course goals.\nOverall, class members loved the welcoming atmosphere that this class provided. Multiple reviewers enjoyed the novelty and energy of this unique subject, as well as the fascinating readings that the professor assigned. As one reviewer remarked, \"this course really offered a new approach to international relations because it focused on clandestine [economics] which [is] often overlooked in mainstream discourse.\" Regarding suggestions for improvement, students would have preferred more visuals and videos to facilitate their learning. In addition, students agreed that a more refined reading list as well as more coherence in themes would further the goals of this course. Respondents recommended that prospective students also shop \"Drug War Politics\" (POLS0820U) and other courses taught by Professor Peter Andreas.

The course allows students to engage with and critically analyze widely circulated claims about democracy in order to evaluate their validity and assess potential strategies. While there are no official prerequisites, respondents noted that experience in political science courses was helpful as was a familiarity with the U.S. political system and current events.\nInstruction consisted of a combination of lectures and discussions, which were described to be extremely interesting and engaging. Respondents noted that instruction was efficient and effective, further praising Professor Robert Blair for being extremely passionate about the material and very available and receptive to students' needs and questions. While some class members indicated that it was occasionally difficult to know what Professor Blair expected, he was nonetheless a fair and timely grader.\nCourse requirements consisted of weekly readings and several different forms of homework (including watching virtual roundtables hosted by Watson, participating in a simulation for a week, and conversing with peers in the class at other schools about democracy in the U.S. and elsewhere). Such tasks were described as manageable but quite time-consuming. There were also two blog posts (800-1200 words), three to five replies to other students' blog posts, a reflection on the simulation (800-1200 words), and a final paper (twelve to seventeen pages).\nOverall, students found the course to be extremely interesting and relevant. Many respondents indicated that the course required a very large time and energy commitment, but was consistently engaging and therefore worthwhile.

The course was taught by Professor Jeffrey Robbins, and enrollment is limited to 20 junior and senior Political Science concentrators. The course has no formal prerequisites, though students noted that having taken other classes in journalism, political science, and IAPA were helpful.\nProfessor Robbins was described as an engaging, knowledgeable instructor, and respondents said he brought a comfortable atmosphere to the discussion-focused class. Each class usually began with a presentation of the week\u2019s topic and then opened into a discussion period for students to share questions and opinions. One student noted that these discussions were very open and relaxed, allowing for students to share their viewpoints without fear of opposition.\nThe class featured weekly readings with several texts each week, six news column style papers, a midterm paper, and a final paper. Some students noted that the readings took a fair amount of time to complete, but they were worthwhile regardless. One student wrote that \u201cthe assignments were effective and the way they are staggered is helpful.\u201d\nOverall, students enjoyed the class and would recommend it to others, especially those with an interest in American politics and journalism. Professor Robbins was highly praised, and students had very little feedback aside from the high volume of readings assigned, for which they cited note-sharing as a permissible solution.

Grading was evenly split between participation (presentations and in-class presence) and the papers. The course\u2019s readings were described as lengthy, relevant, and worthwhile. Overall, assignments were viewed as reasonably difficult and directly related to lectures. In class, students felt like they were given a voice as Professor Blyth highly encouraged discussion and participation. Several students remarked on how great class discussions were.

This sub-field has roots in International Political Economy, Fiscal and Economic Sociology, and Economics. It has as its main foci the politics of economic growth, distribution and (in)equality. The growth program emerged from work on comparative capitalisms in the 1970s and 1980s, coalescing in the highly influential Varieties of Capitalism literature in the 2000s, and latterly in the Growth Models research program. The distributional strand of work focused on the interaction of producer groups and sought to tie political and economic outcomes to the relative strength of such groups. The (in)equality side of the subfield emerged out of studies of welfare states and engagement with the social metrics of comparative economic performance. This course surveys this broad terrain.\n\ninstructor: Instructors\nMark Blyth\nmark_blyth@brown.edu\n\nschedule: Schedule and Location\nM 1:30pm-4pm in 111 Thayer St-Watson Institute 140\n\ncritical_review_url: http://www.thecriticalreview.org/POLS/2215\n\n", "code: POLS 2220\n\nterm: Fall 2024\n\ntitle: Urban Politics\n\ndescription: Covers a number of topics linked to urban politics and urban public policy.

The official prerequisite for the course is \"Basic Persian\" (PRSN0200). Most students had either taken previous classes in the Persian department or were native Farsi speakers looking to further develop their language skills.\nOne respondent wrote that Professor Iradj Anvar is \"a gem,\" a sentiment reflected in many of the questionnaires. Students appreciated Professor Anvar's passion for the language and culture and tendency to \"go above the call of duty\" as a professor, in terms of both involvement and availability outside of class. A common concern, however, was that the professor was not clear enough on how the course was graded.\nMost students spent a little more than five hours per week on \"Intermediate Persian Language and Culture.\" Assignments included reading short stories, writing essays, and translating material. The midterm for the course was a presentation. Class members often remarked that preparing for assignments was difficult. One reviewer recommended more in-class collaboration and wished that there had been a group project assigned.\nAll in all, students were glad to have taken Professor Anvar's \"Intermediate Persian Language and Culture\" course.

Praised for being \"erudite\" and \"super passionate,\" respondents wrote that he created a \"pleasant learning atmosphere\" and greatly enjoyed class discussions. Students wrote that the professor was always available outside of class.\nThe coursework consisted of weekly assignments which were usually short stories and poems that needed to be translated and were discussed in class. There were also multiple midterm projects, as well as discussion of Iranian cinema. Students felt that assignments were of reasonable difficulty and presented the material well, though several felt that sometimes they introduced too many new vocabulary words at once. One student remarked that the classic poetry assigned could be \"extremely difficult but worthwhile\" to the goals of the course. Most reviewers spent between three and five hours a week on this course outside of class, though some averaged ten when projects or midterms were due.\nIn particular, it's important to note that this course is on the Iranian Persian language, which is not the only Persian-speaking country--several class members commented that it would be nice to learn about the other Persian dialects and cultures.

From cooking and talking to prayer and devotion, the \u201creligious\u201d and \u201cnon-religious\u201d things people do tell us a lot about how religion animates and is animated by lived experience, and how porous the boundary is between the \u201csacred\u201d and \u201cprofane\u201d.\n\ninstructor: Instructors\nKera Street\nkera_street@brown.edu\n\nschedule: Schedule and Location\nTTh 2:30pm-3:50pm Location TBD\n\nprograms: Curricular Programs\nRace, Power, and Privilege (RPP)\nWriting - Designated Courses (WRIT)\n\ncritical_review_url: http://www.thecriticalreview.org/RELS/0012\n\n", "code: RELS 0021\n\nterm: Spring 2025\n\ntitle: Inequality in the Ancient World\n\ndescription: This course examines various forms of inequality in the ancient world as well as the range of responses to it by those who resist it and reject it.

Coming to terms with these diverse materials may reveal to us some of our own assumptions about death, dying, and the afterlife.\n\ninstructor: Instructors\nJason Protass\njason_protass@brown.edu\n\nschedule: Schedule and Location\nTTh 10:30am-11:50am Location TBD\n\nprograms: Curricular Programs\nWriting - Designated Courses (WRIT)\n\ncritical_review_url: http://www.thecriticalreview.org/RELS/0045\n\n", "code: RELS 0067\n\nterm: Fall 2024\n\ntitle: Divine Drugs: Psychedelics, Religion, and Spirituality\n\ndescription: From LSD to magic mushrooms, mescaline to ayahuasca, psychedelics are drugs that alter consciousness and perceptions of reality. This course investigates the central role that religion and spirituality have played in the long, tangled history of psychedelics, from colonial eradication of psychedelics as indigenous sacraments, to psychedelic modes of expanding consciousness in 1960s counterculture; from the moral panic around these substances as a tool of mind control, to their present scientific investigation as a panacea for mental health, addiction, and self-realization. Interweaving primary sources and scholarly accounts on psychedelics, our inquiry will use an interdisciplinary approach, blending religious studies, philology, anthropology, the history of science, and art history. To explore this varied terrain, we survey the history of divine drugs around the world, even as we ruminate on the wisdom and philosophy they have inspired over the ages.\n\ninstructor: Instructors\nFinnian Moore-Gerety\nfinnian_moore-gerety@brown.edu\n\nschedule: Schedule and Location\nTTh 1pm-2:20pm in List Art Center 110\n\nprograms: Curricular Programs\nWriting - Designated Courses (WRIT)\n\ncritical_review_url: http://www.thecriticalreview.org/RELS/0067\n\n", "code: RELS 0085F\n\nterm: Fall 2024\n\ntitle: The Christian Right\n\ndescription: An introductory cultural and historical study of conservative Christianity in the United States.

Wars, assassinations, emperors, oh my! But a subject that receives far less attention in popular culture is Roman religion, and specifically what Roman religion was like for women. This very subject is deeply explored in Professor Susan Harvey\u2019s first year seminar \u201cWomen and Gender in Ancient Religions'' (RELS0090A). This course examines what religion was like for women in the ancient Mediterranean world, and explores whether religions were gendered and whether ideas of gender were fixed or fluid. These topics, as well as many others, are examined through a consideration of Greek, Roman, Jewish, and Christian religions between roughly 500 BCE and 500 CE, with a focus on the Roman Empire. This writ-designated seminar has no prerequisites, but a previous student noted that having a background in religion, mythology, and history was helpful.\nStudents of \u201cWomen and Gender in Ancient Religions\u201d thoroughly enjoyed Professor Harvey\u2019s discussion-based teaching style. Several students highlighted that she promoted interesting discussion, with one student appreciating that she would raise questions relevant to the class\u2019s assigned papers. Another student observed that Professor Harvey was clearly knowledgeable and passionate about the topic, and another reviewer praised her as lovely and very responsive to comments.\nIn terms of workload, students were expected to complete weekly readings between 100 and 400 pages long, a weekly canvas post in response to those readings, and three five to seven page papers. Reviewers noted that they often spent a significant amount of time on the readings, but that the three papers were manageable, mainly focusing on literary analysis rather than research. On average students spent one to five hours per week on work for this course.\nOverall, students enjoyed \u201cWomen and Gender in Ancient Religions\u201d and found the course content interesting. However, one student did note that \u201cyou have to dedicate a lot of time to read,\u201d while another student commented that the readings were often long, dense, and at times uninteresting. Additionally, another reviewer wished there had been more varied perspectives introduced during class discussion. Yet, overall, students greatly enjoyed \u201cWomen and Gender in Ancient Religions,\u201d praising its interesting content and exciting nature. So, if you\u2019re a first year student who wants to learn more about women\u2019s role in religion during the Roman Empire, or about gender in Ancient Religions in general, you should definitely consider taking this seminar!\n\ninstructor: Instructors\nSusan Harvey\nsusan_harvey@brown.edu\n\nschedule: Schedule and Location\nTh 4pm-6:30pm in 59 George St- S.

The course covers Indigenous environmental perspectives and practices as expressed by Indigenous authors, elders, film producers, and community members. It also examines the impact of settler colonialism and dispossession on Indigenous populations. The geographical focus of the course is mostly on North America, but there is some discussion of communities from Australia and New Zealand. This course also examines Brown University\u2019s relation to local Indigenous lands and populations, and how Indigenous research methods could inform Brown\u2019s scholarly community. This is a first-year seminar, and there are no prerequisites.\nProfessor Mark Cladis was described as a caring instructor who encouraged students\u2019 growth, and who was always available outside of class to answer students\u2019 questions and concerns. Students noted that Professor Cladis\u2019s \u201chands-off\u201d teaching style allowed for the voices and perspectives of Indigenous community members to speak for themselves. However, there were mixed reactions to this teaching style; while some students felt that they benefited from the independence, others requested more structure and guidelines.\nThe coursework consisted of weekly readings (each about 60-80 pages long) and videos, weekly journal reflections, one student-led discussion, a take-home midterm exam, and a take-home final exam. One student advised prospective students to complete the weekly readings in order to get the most out of the class.\nOverall, students felt this seminar was valuable; one student enthusiastically suggested that it should be \u201cmandatory\u201d for all incoming students.

The course considers how the basic elements of the distinctive Chinese worldview shaped the nature of religious practice and experience, and primary sources make up a good percentage of the readings. There are no prerequisites, but students agreed that previous experience in philosophy was helpful.\nStudents found Professor Larson DiFiori to be passionate and knowledgeable about Chinese philosophy, but felt he was also laid back and had a good sense of humor. One respondent described Professor DiFiori as having a \u201cwealth of personal stories.\u201d The class was a mixture of lecture and discussion; Professor Difiori typically went over the week\u2019s readings and emphasized important points or areas of confusion and then opened up the conversation to student discussion. Respondents appreciated this structure, especially for the chance to get clarifications on the dense primary sources. The professor was readily available outside of class and provided useful feedback on written work.\nAssignments for the course consisted of weekly readings, a weekly 100-word discussion post on Canvas, being a class discussion leader at least three times throughout the semester, two papers that were seven pages each, and a final paper that was eight to ten pages. Because of the flexible nature of the assignments, students were able to choose topics of personal interest, making the papers fun and rewarding. There was a consensus that the all assignments were relevant and of appropriate difficulty, and Professor DiFiori helped walk students through the more onerous readings. One respondent concluded that it was easy to do well so long as one is willing to do the work and show up for class.\nOverall, students enjoyed \u201cThe Classical Chinese Philosophy of Life.\u201d The course built on previous foundations of philosophy and contemplative studies, and Professor DiFiori\u2019s enthusiasm made class enjoyable.

Others cited an interest in the themes of the course as good preparation to engage with the material.\nRespondents described Professor Cladis as caring and \"beyond passionate\" about the material, as well as supportive of student needs, questions, and perspectives. He was also praised for building a \"true community out of the class\" and his casual style of teaching, encouraging conversation but not demanding answers. However, some students noted that his support of all thoughts and comments sometimes translates into a lack of intellectual rigor, so readings were not covered in depth.\nAssignments for the course consisted of weekly readings and journal entries, one midterm, one final written response, and two individual projects.

This course provides an introduction to the ancient world of magic through weekly readings and engaging class discussions. There are no prerequisites for the course, but many students noted that having a background in religious studies, philosophy, or anthropology could be helpful.\nProfessor Jae Han received rave reviews for his engaging teaching and passion for the material. He used a combination of lecture and discussion to instruct the course. Professor Han was described as a \u201cgreat facilitator\u201d who allowed students to lead the direction of discussion and only sometimes jumped in to cover the context of the readings. Students praised him for the excellent discussion, as well as the fun and stimulating atmosphere. Respondents noted that Professor Han was eager to meet with students, and he gave timely feedback and promptly responded to emails.\nAs with most WRIT classes, the majority of the coursework consisted of weekly readings and written work. Students had three weekly readings for the class, one of which was a theoretical secondary source specifically for Friday discussions. They were also assigned two three-page papers, and a twelve-page final paper. Many respondents noted that the paper topics were open-ended and allowed for self-expression, though Professor Han still provided some structure and guidance for the final paper. On average, students spend approximately four hours a week on this class, and up to eight hours when working on the papers.\nOverall, respondents largely enjoyed \u201cDefense Against The Dark Arts In The Ancient World.\u201d They found the material to be interesting and thought-provoking, and Professor Han to be an \u201cabsolute joy\u201d in class. Some students noted that the class could be improved by narrowing its scope so that it would require less background explanation and be more easily accessible. However, others mentioned that it would be interesting to expand the materials to cover the history of magic outside of the Western world.

Starting from a perspective of a person not as a unitary, monolithic entity, but rather as a composite of energies and influences, these practices seek to harmonize, balance, and transform the person.

This course is a junior seminar required for Religious Studies concentrators, so previous religious studies courses and preparation for contemplating abstract concepts within the religious sphere were required for students to succeed in this course.\nProfessor Bush was praised for being passionate and clearly well-versed in his instruction, encouraging all students to participate in class. Class would often begin with a (sometimes short) lecture about the readings then transition to discussion, which was useful for understanding the oftentimes challenging material. One respondent sought more moderation by Bush and less encouragement of tangents during lecture. Nevertheless, Bush\u2019s feedback was very thorough and helpful, with one student remarking that these personalized critiques were one of their favorite parts of Bush\u2019s teaching style.\nCourse load consisted of around three to five reading assignments every week and extensive reading reflections (due at 10pm every Sunday), as well as two 10 to 12-page papers. The majority of reviewers deemed the workload fairly heavy, with the readings on religious theory abstract, archaic, and dense. While these texts were difficult to engage with, this exposure to seminal texts required readers to think critically, which helped students in religious studies. Respondents recommended doing these readings, participating in class, and brainstorming ideas for the papers, as reviews were mixed regarding how thorough, fairly, and timely feedback was returned.\nOverall, students considered RELS1000 a meaningful and beneficial course that required considerable time commitment. For Religious Studies concentrators, this course offers a wide-ranging review of the religious studies canon.\n\ninstructor: Instructors\nKera Street\nkera_street@brown.edu\n\nschedule: Schedule and Location\nW 3pm-5:30pm in 59 George St- S.

As per the course description, the course explores topics including Marian piety, Marian relics, Mary in the context of violence, and Mary in the context of cultural metaphors. Students expressed that no background religious knowledge was necessary for the course, but basic knowledge of Christianity proved helpful.\nStudents praised Professor Susan Harvey for her kindness and passionate lectures, with one student expressing that she was the best professor they have had at Brown. Throughout, Professor Harvey was an encouraging and thorough professor, and students felt that she was genuinely interested in their observations and perspectives. In addition, her general compassion for students both within and outside of the realm of academics created a positive class atmosphere. Discussions were excellently facilitated, and Harvey provided useful feedback on written assignments. Students also expressed that the class\u2019 office hours were both pleasant and helpful.\nThe coursework consisted of weekly readings, two one-page response papers on a field trip and guest lecture, two five-page papers, and one 10 to 15-page final research paper or a creative project. Students emphasized that the readings were often long and difficult to get through as many of them were primary source materials from antiquity. Students appreciated the creative nature of the final project which allowed them to work in whatever direction and with whatever medium they desired.\nOverall, students greatly enjoyed RELS1325 and found the material particularly poignant and thought-provoking. Students appreciated the close-knit class atmosphere as well as Harvey\u2019s passionate and kind presence as a professor. Students emphasized that prior knowledge of religion was not necessary for the class, and those without a general knowledge of Christianity were not at a deficit at all.

Since this was an introductory course, there were no official prerequisites, but most students found having studied another foreign language to be useful because they were able to easily transfer study methods and some grammar (depending on the language studied).\nChristopher Carr was the instructor who led classes. Because the class was so small, many class members appreciated the individualized attention that they were able to receive from him. They found him easy to approach with questions and patient in answering them. Reviewers also noted that he was very enthusiastic and easily reachable by email.\nCoursework included six unit exams, two papers, weekly listening quizzes, weekly graded homework assignments, and daily homework. The textbook was seen as helpful and necessary since students were expected to have studied and formed a basic grasp of the material on their own before attending each lecture. There were mixed reviews about the worksheets that were provided for practice: Some survey respondents found them helpful for reinforcing material, but others found them redundant and repetitive. Even though the number of assignments was very high, reviewers pointed out that it actually wasn't that much work since the assignments themselves weren't very difficult.\nStudents recommended this course as a solid introduction to Russian for \"everyone who loves Russian literature, history, or culture,\" saying that even though the workload and daily classes may seem intimidating at first, it's extremely rewarding in the end.\n\ninstructor: Instructors\nLynne deBenedette\nlynne_debenedette@brown.edu\nMarisa Dodd\namarica_dodd@brown.edu\n\nschedule: Schedule and Location\nMWF 11am-11:50am in Friedman Hall 003\nTTh 12pm-12:50pm in Friedman Hall 201\n\nprograms: Curricular Programs\nFirst Half of Year Course (YC01)\n\naverage_hours: 7.25\n\nmax_hours: 9.50\n\ncourse_rating: 83%\n4.16\n\nprofessor_rating: 52%\n4.53\n\nprofessor_and_term: RUSS 0100 | Debenedette, Lynne (S1) | Fall 2012\n\n", "code: RUSS 0110\n\nterm: Spring 2025\n\ntitle: Intensive Russian\n\ndescription: \"Intensive Russian\" (RUSS0110) is an introductory Russian course that compresses two semesters of beginning Russian into one. The course teaches students how to read, write, and speak Russian. In addition, it also delves into Russian culture. Although there were no formal prerequisites for the course, respondents noted that experience with learning other foreign languages was helpful.\nProfessor Lynne Debenedette received warm reviews from her students. She was described by class members as a passionate and knowledgeable teacher who was particularly effective at facilitating participation and discussion in class. Respondents also appreciated her availability and helpfulness outside of class during office hours.\nIntensive Russian was a very time consuming course, with the syllabus stating that students would be spending 10-15 hours on it outside of class (students reported similar results). Students were responsible for completing homework assignments and readings for every class. There were also tests every two weeks and an oral exam. Respondents noted that, while time consuming, the assignments were very relevant to course material.\nOverall, students really enjoyed \"Intensive Russian,\" mainly because of their love for the professor. Although respondents felt that her grading could have been more timely, their feedback on other aspects of the course was mostly positive. Students felt that prospective shoppers should make sure they have a strong interest in languages, specifically Russian, as the course is very time-intensive.

The prerequisite for the course is RUSS0100, the first semester of the year-long sequence. Respondents agreed that RUSS0100 alone was sufficient preparation for success in the continuation of the course.\nProfessor Diana Dukhanova was praised by her students for being an enthusiastic instructor whose encouragement of small group discussions helped to foster an atmosphere of openness in the classroom. Many respondents found that this environment allowed them to be comfortable and have fun while learning essential conversational skills. The organization of the course received mixed reviews; as one respondent explained, the due dates for assignments were unclear on occasion, and they wished for less ambiguous expectations.\nThe assignments for this course were described by students as being very manageable for a class that met five times a week. The daily homework consisted of readings of small passages and there were two papers due throughout the semester. The examinations for this course consisted of approximately three to four quizzes, oral assessments, and three exams.\nA noteworthy aspect of this course for the majority of the respondents was the ability to interact with other students in the class.

There are no formal prerequisites; most students had only high school English as a background.\nProfessor Vladimir Golstein\u2019s teaching style was lecture-based, with minimal class discussion. Some students found this to be effective, as they liked the content of the class and thought that he was an engaging speaker. Others would have preferred a more discussion-based approach and commented that two and a half hours of pure lecturing could become monotonous. Responses on his feedback and availability were varied \u2013 some said he responded to emails quickly, while others thought his responses were less timely. Although many students would have liked to have received more feedback, they found it effective and helpful when he provided it.\nCoursework for RUSS0320E included about 150 pages of reading each week, weekly responses, two ten-page papers, and two presentations. Students thought the readings were long and required a significant amount a time but were relevant to course goals. The papers were \u201ctricky to do well, but in the end very valuable.\u201d\nOverall, students enjoyed RUSS0320E and the information it had to offer. They praised Professor Golstein for his charisma, enthusiasm, and effectiveness as a lecturer.

Students reported that no prerequisite is necessary for this introductory course, but some did note that background knowledge in sign language or previous experience of taking language courses at Brown could be beneficial.\nProfessor Heather Nowicki was very receptive to student's needs and very accommodating. She used PowerPoints to guide the class discussion and explain concepts that students would otherwise not have understood if they were signed. During the class, breakout groups were frequently used, which was reported to be a great way to practice signing. One student mentioned that, while complete immersion in ASL could be nerve-wracking at the beginning, it forced students to actively engage with the language, which helped them pick up things very quickly.

SIGN0300 takes an immersive approach to foster intermediate communication skills and explore deaf culture topics such as family dynamics, literacy, and education. SIGN0100 and SIGN0200 are prerequisites, and the course is limited to 18 enrollees.\nProfessor Timothy Riker, affectionately called Tim by his students, is deaf and a native signer \u2014 his course is all-immersive. Students praised this style of teaching. He is regarded as an enthusiastic, comedic, and engaging professor, and uses a mix of PowerPoint presentations and discussion. There is no verbal component to this class. Students commented on his consistent availability outside of class and varied response times to emails.\nThe course consists of five video projects (each with a first draft, peer feedback, a final draft, and a self-evaluation), biweekly ASL journals, and class reading. Students were also required to go to a minimum of five ASL-related events on their own time. There are no midterms, papers, or final exams. Respondents agreed that the assignments were fairly time-consuming and required a lot of preparation, but got easier as the class progressed. All assignments were relevant to course goals, and greatly improved students' skill sets.\nWhen asked what was most memorable about SIGN0300, students mentioned Tim\u2019s passion about ASL and the course\u2019s focus on deaf culture. They loved his personality and teaching style, and for many, SIGN0300 became their favorite course at Brown. The only strong suggestions for improvement were more timely grading and less emphasis on video journals.

The prerequisites for this course include SIGN0100, SIGN0200, and SIGN0300.\nStudents agreed that Professor Timothy Riker was encouraging, motivating as a lecturer, easy to understand, and that he cared about students and wanted to see them succeed. However, respondents noted that this was the professor\u2019s first semester teaching, and that he joined the class halfway through the year. As such, students felt he would have been more effective as an instructor if he had a better understanding of the level each student was on, and if he had used this information to construct adequately challenging lectures and assignments. Outside of class, he was approachable, friendly, and readily available during office hours.\nThe course workload consisted of three video projects with presentations, three written exams, attendance to three events outside of class, and a final oral \u201cinterview\u201d exam. There were few readings, as lecture videos substituted for written articles or books. Respondents agreed that the video lectures were applicable to their studies and useful for reinforcing class concepts. They also appreciated the professor\u2019s extensive feedback on their assignments, which consisted of both written comments and individual meetings to discuss their progress.\nOverall, students spent about three hours per week on this course, a relatively light work load. Respondents suggested that the level of the class could be heightened, and that time be dedicated to discussion of current events. Despite their quibbles, students unanimously agreed that students should look into ASL, due to its \u201cimportance\u201d in society and the \u201camazing\u201d impact that learning it can have on the lives of others.\n\ninstructor: Instructors\nTimothy Riker\ntimothy_riker@brown.edu\n\nschedule: Schedule and Location\nMWF 12pm-12:50pm Location TBD\n\naverage_hours: 1.20\n\nmax_hours: 2.80\n\ncourse_rating: 57%\n4.27\n\nprofessor_rating: 81%\n4.57\n\nprofessor_and_term: SIGN 0400 | Riker, Timothy (S1) | Spring 2013\n\n", "code: SIGN 0500\n\nterm: Fall 2024\n\ntitle: American Sign Language V\n\ndescription: \"American Sign Language V\" (SIGN 0500-S01) is a course that focuses on strengthening American Sign Language grammar and discussion skills in both formal and informal settings.

He was very patient and understanding with his lessons and willing to explain concepts again if necessary. Professor Riker's class format involved participation from all students, but most students felt comfortable with the environment because of Professor Riker's calm, open demeanor and ability to fully listen to and answer questions. According to many reviewers, he greatly strengthened their ASL skills and helped them become comfortable signing in different settings. Students said that Professor Riker was consistently available to provide feedback and constructively discuss a students' strengths, as well as possible areas for improvement. Reviewers also stressed that he was never negative about students' abilities and willing to help whoever needed further instruction.\nStudents found the regular class readings, which consisted of formal health presentations, informal discussions, and storytelling, helpful and insightful. A few students desired even more in-depth readings to help with their knowledge of deaf culture and ASL as a whole. Coursework was comprised of regular readings and five in-class presentations.\nStudents spent about one to three hours per week completing coursework.

Many respondents emphasized that Professor Hirschman\u2019s lectures were notably clear and easily accessible; a few students commented that his frequent connections between the broad subjects covered made the topics discussed seem more cohesive and interesting. Even more, he and the TAs of the course was noted to be very receptive to meeting students during office hours.\nCoursework for SOC0010 consisted of weekly readings and canvas posts.

This course seeks to introduce students to the sociological study of sex and gender, and explores how society constructs gender differences, how sexuality influences our lives, and how sexuality is reflected through social norms, public policies, and in social institutions. Although this course has no prerequisites, one student found having taken writing-intensive courses to be helpful for this course, as many of the important assignments are writing focused.\nStudents of \u201cSex, Gender, and Society\u201d felt that Professor Musto\u2019s mixture of lecture and discussion was highly effective. One student explained that although the course can be theory-heavy, Professor Musto effectively balanced the theory with pertinent discussion.

Feedback was thorough and immensely helpful.\nCourse requirements included weekly homework assignments, three exams, and a final research project. Reviewers uniformly indicated that coursework was often tedious and a little challenging, but was manageable, reasonable, and relevant overall. Though examinations were described as \"fairly easy,\" students pointed to the semester-long project as being somewhat difficult at the outset of the course.\nThis introductory statistics course was viewed by all students as constituting a valuable learning experience and a class that they would suggest to potential shoppers. Yet, many respondents noted that their time in this class could be improved if the professor provided a more detailed explanation of how to use STATA for the project, made section optional, and had TAs who were much more experienced and knowledgeable in conducting research using STATA. Nonetheless, when asked what made the course unique or memorable, a majority of students responded that it was the instructor, who was \"amazing,\" due to her positivity, passion, enthusiasm, and the way in which she made statistics painless. Reviewers urge future students to definitely take the class for a grade!\n\ninstructor: Instructors\nJennifer Candipan\njennifer_candipan@brown.edu\n\nschedule: Schedule and Location\nTTh 1pm-2:20pm in Bio Med Center 202\n\naverage_hours: 2.04\n\nmax_hours: 4.15\n\ncourse_rating: 69%\n4.29\n\nprofessor_rating: 87%\n4.60\n\nprofessor_and_term: SOC 1100 | Rauscher, Emily (S1) | Fall 2019\n\n", "code: SOC 1116\n\nterm: Spring 2025\n\ntitle: Criminal Courts and the Law in an Era of Mass Incarceration\n\ndescription: This course provides a comprehensive introduction to America\u2019s criminal court system and all its institutional stakeholders.

If you do, \u201cSample Surveys in Social Research\u201d might be the class for you. The class is designed to teach students about all of the aspects involved in writing, conducting, and reviewing a survey. The course uses social research theory to teach its students how to effectively come up with questions, how to effectively interview people, how to come up with the data, how to make sense of the data, and how to draw a conclusion from the whole process. It\u2019s a hands on class as students enrolled in the course are expected to make their own surveys, analyze the results from their surveys, and write reports on their conclusions. The only prerequisite was the introductory statistics course in the Sociology department, and students stated that having some statistics background was helpful for the course.\nThe class thought that Professor Spearin did a great job using PowerPoint to teach the class material. However, some students felt that not having the slides after class took away from the amount of information they could have absorbed. Some students stated that the class moved at a slow pace and that the readings were not very well tied into the class material. The reviewers praised Professor Spearin for being very accessible, helpful, and knowledgeable. The respondents also said that Professor Spearin was always open to questions and was very engaging.\nThe class believed that the textbook readings were not very useful for the class but said that the online readings were very useful. The course consisted of one exam, five assignments, and one presentation. Most students found the work to be manageable and did not recommend any changes in the curriculum.\nThe majority of respondents stated that they spent two to five hours a week working on the material for the class. This matched most of their expectations on the amount of work they were going to receive. Students recommended taking this class because of its very useful real world applications, especially for those who want to go into the research field later.\n\ninstructor: Instructors\nCarrie Spearin\ncarrie_spearin@brown.edu\n\nschedule: Schedule and Location\nMWF 9am-9:50am Location TBD\n\nprograms: Curricular Programs\nCommunity-Based Learning and Research (CBLR)\n\naverage_hours: N/A\n\nmax_hours: N/A\n\ncourse_rating: 41%\n4.39\n\nprofessor_rating: 61%\n4.56\n\nprofessor_and_term: SOC 1120 | Spearin, Carrie (S1) | Fall 2007\n\n", "code: SOC 1270\n\nterm: Spring 2025\n\ntitle: Race, Class, and Ethnicity in the Modern World\n\ndescription: \u201cRace, Class, and Ethnicity in the Modern World\u201d (SOC1270) is a sociological analysis of historical and modern-day race relations, particularly in the United States. Broadly, it focuses on the impacts of racism and colonialism on the world today, taking a long view of historical processes that have developed over time and drawing much of its sociological analysis from the work of W.E.B. Du Bois. There are no prerequisites for this class, and reviewers noted that no particular prior coursework was necessary, although past humanities coursework that dealt with race could be useful.\nProfessor Jos\u00e9 Itzigsohn taught this class through a combination of lecture and discussion. It met three times per week; on one day Professor Itzigsohn lectured, and on the other two, the class discussed the material in small or large groups. Students were expected to lead some of these discussions themselves. Respondents praised the professor\u2019s effective presentation of information, encouragement of discussion, and clear passion for the material. However, they found his lecturing style to be a little dry and some class periods boring, which they said damaged their motivation to attend.\nGrading in SOC1270 was based on many small assignments instead of a traditional midterm or final. Assignments included weekly Canvas posts and responses to other students' short reading responses, two longer papers, a book review, and a policy memo group project. Students appreciated that grades were deemphasized in importance, and generally found them to be fair, but expressed a desire for clearer explanations of grading and more feedback on writing. They also said they wished the expectations for the writing assignments were more concrete.\nOverall, respondents said SOC1270 covered essential, compelling information about relevant racial issues, and recommended it for that reason. They said prospective students should be aware that this class can be hard to stay engaged in, but that it wasn\u2019t too challenging and the workload easy to manage. Stressing the importance of the content, one reviewer called the class \u201ceye opening.\u201d Shopping or taking this class was recommended to concentrators and non-concentrators alike; anybody who is interested in a sociological perspective on race relations might like this class.\n\ninstructor: Instructors\nJose Itzigsohn\njose_itzigsohn@brown.edu\n\nschedule: Schedule and Location\nMWF 2pm-2:50pm Location TBD\n\nprograms: Curricular Programs\nRace, Power, and Privilege (RPP)\n\naverage_hours: 2.44\n\nmax_hours: 5.22\n\ncourse_rating: 51%\n3.83\n\nprofessor_rating: 74%\n4.58\n\nprofessor_and_term: SOC 1270 | Itzigsohn, Jose (S1) | Fall 2021\n\n", "code: SOC 1311\n\nterm: Fall 2024\n\ntitle: Micro-Organizational Theory: Social Behavior in Organizations\n\ndescription: Most people don\u2019t really consider the individuals working within organizations. We don\u2019t talk about Apple\u2019s successes as if the new iPhone is the result of cumulative individual decisions and behavior. However, if you are interested in learning about how individual attitudes and behavior affect organizations, you should definitely check out Professor Ananda Martin-Caughey's class \u201cMicro-Organizational Theory: Social Behavior in Organizations\u201d (SOC1311). This course uses a more microscopic perspective to explain why individuals in organizations behave the way they do and how they both affect and are affected by their organizations. This course has no prerequisites, but one student noted that previous courses in behavioral decision sciences and sociology were helpful.\nReviewers of \u201cMicro-Organizational Theory: Social Behavior in Organizations\u201d found Professor Martin-Caughey\u2019s lecture style effective. Two students emphasized that her class and lectures were very interesting, and another student described her as simply amazing. One student also described Professor Martin-Caughey as super caring and intelligent and well-prepared, and appreciated that \u201cshe always gives you the golden nuggets of information\u201d in her lectures.\nThe workload for \u201cMicro-Organizational Theory: Social Behavior in Organizations'' reported that students were expected to complete approximately three readings a week, one midterm paper, one research paper, and a group project. The course ended with both a final exam and final project. Although one student explained that all these assignments could amount to more work than they were expecting for this course, another student explained that doing the readings made assignments like exams less difficult. On average students spent about five hours per week on coursework, but that average jumped up to almost nine and a half hours during intensive periods of exams, projects, or essays.\nOverall, students enjoyed \u201cMicro-Organizational Theory: Social Behavior in Organizations.\u201d One student did wish that the workload had been slightly more balanced, as it at times felt that more work was assigned than necessary to master course material.

There is no official prerequisite for this course, but many students cited \"Organizations in Society\" (SOC0300) and \"Micro-Organizational Theory: Social Behavior in Organizations\" (SOC1311) as helpful background.\nProfessor Suchman was praised for his \"streamlined\" organization in course planning, as well as his knowledge and passion for the material. However, one class member noted that he would occasionally talk above his students' understanding level. Respondents found him to be accommodating and receptive to student feedback.\nAssignments consisted of three to four weekly readings and Canvas posts. Students also completed one individual and two group papers in addition to one take-home exam in the form of a 9 to 10-page paper. While respondents generally agreed that the papers and projects were relevant to the course material, some suggested that the amount of readings could be decreased. On average, class members spent about six hours each week on work outside of class.\nOverall, respondents enjoyed the class, but, due to its heavy workload, the course was recommended primarily to Sociology or BEO concentrators. Prospective students are advised to bear in mind that this is a theory-based course, so students who prefer more concrete examples may want to shop for other courses. One class member recommended that future remote attendees of this course should try and stay as on track as possible with assignments, especially group projects, as \"the work piles up fast.\" Shoppers may also want to try out SOC1311.\n\ninstructor: Instructors\nJohn Diamond\njohn_b_diamond@brown.edu\n\nschedule: Schedule and Location\nMWF 1pm-1:50pm Location TBD\n\nprograms: Curricular Programs\nWriting - Designated Courses (WRIT)\n\naverage_hours: 5.40\n\nmax_hours: 10.47\n\ncourse_rating: 51%\n3.82\n\nprofessor_rating: 60%\n4.05\n\nprofessor_and_term: SOC 1315 | Suchman, Mark (S1) | Fall 2020\n\n", "code: SOC 1340\n\nterm: Fall 2024\n\ntitle: Principles and Methods of Geographic Information Systems\n\ndescription: An introduction to the fundamental principles and methods of geographic information systems (GIS).

The course introduces students to the critical thinking, methodological changes, and historical imagination surrounding sociological theory. Respondents did not mention any particular courses to be prerequisites, though a strong background in sociology helped some students.\nStudents indicated that Professor Jose Itzigsohn was effective in their flexibility, friendliness, and lectures, which helped clarify the often dense and difficult readings. Respondents indicated that Professor Itzigsohn encouraged students to reach their own conclusions, even if they disagreed with the instructor\u2019s own opinions. The free-thinking environment they fostered helped facilitate open discussion, and students found that such an environment greatly added to the course.\nThe course consisted of weekly readings on texts from famous sociological thinkers, weekly reading responses on Canvas, a presentation on a reading, a midterm, and a final paper. Students found the readings to be particularly intensive, though the lectures were helpful to supplement. The writing assignments in the course were also somewhat challenging given their length, and some students believed that the writing assignments were too long.\nOverall, students seemed to enjoy the creative and intellectual freedom that Professor Itzigsohn created in this course, and the material was highly intriguing for many.

The class is designed to be an integrated piece within Brown's Sociology Department and will familiarize students with various faculty of the department and their work. Additionally\u2014while it's not explicitly a writing course\u2014students will gain considerable experience in writing, review, and revision, as well as knowledge of the process for getting grants and publications. Reviewers found that previous experience or a general interest in social research, along with background knowledge in sociology, helped them with this course.\nClass members considered Professor Mark Suchman to be an overall effective instructor. They especially appreciated his ability to encourage questions and his patience in addressing student concerns. The only thing reviewers considered ineffective about classroom operations was that Professor Suchman's intense lecture pace and teaching style, coupled with minimal breaks, at times caused too many things to be crowded into one class.\nCourse requirements included weekly readings that were on average 120 pages, but occasionally crept above 200. Students were required to post one question a week to Canvas regarding the readings as well as respond to one fellow student's question. There were also a number of \"quasi-weekly\" assignments spread out throughout the semester. Respondents forewarned prospective students that the time commitment for these assignments could become large. Finally, students were asked to submit a 15 to 20-page research project proposal at the end of the semester. Students were also required to be active participants in class discussion as part of their grade.\nThe philosophy of this course is best put in Professor Suchman's own words: \"Graduate school is a long and exciting journey. This semester won\u2019t carry you through to your destination, but it will help you to embark, get your bearings, and set a course.

Many scientific workers\u2013including translators, activists, archivists, technicians, curators, and ethics review boards\u2013are absent in publications and omitted from stories of discovery.

How do scientific ideas become knowledge? What is the nature of scientific objectivity, how can it be compromised?\" \"Introduction to Science and Society\" (STS1000) attempts to answer these questions by offering an introduction to the interdisciplinary field of science studies. Topics explored in this course include gender and race, psychiatric classification, the drug industry, science and religion, and the use of nuclear weapons during World War II. Enrollment is limited to sophomores, juniors, seniors. There are no official prerequisites, and students came into the class with a wide variety of background including biology, chemistry, physics, philosophy, and history.\nProfessor Joan Richards was said to be caring about her students and passionate about science studies. Students reported that although the goal was to have class discussions, Professor Richards often talked too frequently and for too long and could go off on tangents. Nonetheless, respondents found that Professor Richards was available and accommodating outside the classroom and provided constructive feedback on all the assignments.\nThe course assignments consisted of readings with reading responses, discussion facilitation, and a final research paper. Throughout the course, students would alternate in three roles: discussion facilitators, reviewers, and essay writers. Some respondents found this system slightly confusing. Although half of reviewers found the readings difficult, all agreed that the readings felt relevant to the course goals.\nStudents found this class to be unique due to its three-group structure with alternating responsibilities. In addition, they enjoyed the content, which raised key questions that relate to how science is conducted. The small class size was especially conducive to the discussion-based course. Students said the course could be improved if there was more structure during the discussions and if they were held more accountable for the readings. Respondents said that interested students should also consider other STS classes, but many noted that no other course is similar to STS1000.

Reviewers liked the incredible passion she brought to class, and how she was able to conduct a class that flowed naturally and did not feel forced.\nAssignments for the course consisted mostly of group scenes that students would work on with their partners, along with short responses after each performance. There were also some readings, especially at the start of the semester, that were largely considered to be relatively easy. The course also includes a mandatory tech component, which involves students serving as the backstage and technical crew for one of the TAPS departments\u2019 productions for the semester.\nOverall, reviewers recommended the course.

The class, with no prerequisite classes, is designed as an introductory course for those with little or no experience in the area\u2014though students mentioned that backgrounds in the literary arts and writing, particularly writing for theater plays was helpful.\nProfessor Terry-Morgan was described as very supportive of students\u2019 creativity and willingness to try new things. Many appreciated how he was very accommodating, as he allowed students to take the lead in workshops and presentations, which was found to be helpful in improving their playwriting abilities. Students also praised Professor Terry-Morgan\u2019s enthusiasm for the art of playwriting in general, as well as his efforts to connect with every student individually, create a positive and uplifting classroom environment, and ensure they were properly accommodated.\nClasswork for TAPS0100 consisted of two to three readings for the semester, as well as one three-to-five page scene weekly and a twenty-page play for the final exam. Discussions of reading and workshops were mainly student-led, and generally described as fun. The workshops were devoted to the discussion of student written plays; as such, many respondents underscored the importance of devoting apt time to writing the plays before such workshops.\nOverall, the class was described as a course that can be challenging but is always rewarding. Even more, TAPS0100 was regarded as a perfect introduction for students both outside and inside of the concentration.

However, students noted that a background in theatre was also helpful in preparing for TAPS0200.\nStudents praised Professor Searle for having a \"passionate\" and \"incredibly engaging\" teaching style. Respondents enjoyed her relaxed class structure, which provided a forum for discussions and the development of ideas. However, some students wished that Professor Searle had provided more structure, as discussions sometimes could be unfocused and poorly time-managed. Most students agreed that Professor Searle was usually available outside of class but failed to respond to emails in a timely manner.\nThe assignments for TAPS0200 consisted of facilitating class discussion, weekly readings, writing weekly short plays, and continuously working on a longer final play throughout the semester. Students felt that the assignments were usually relevant to class material but would have liked more structure. In addition, students felt that facilitated discussion was often not as relevant. Students reported spending on average about three hours per week on the course and about five on a busy week.\nIn general, students enjoyed the small class size and the in-class discussions. Students noted that Professor Searle often diverged from deadlines on the syllabus; respondents stated that they would have appreciated more structure in course content and more notice before assignments were due. In addition, students recommended that in the future Professor Searle should add peer workshopping to the class in order to learn more from fellow peers. The course was mixed with both concentrators and non-concentrators as well as those who were taking the class as a requirement.

This hands-on class teaches students the foundations of stagecraft, sound, and lighting\u2014 specific skills include woodworking and using power tools. Although some students had a background with certain tools or woodworking, all respondents emphasized that someone with no technical or theater experience could absolutely succeed in the class. All the mechanics of using different tools and basic theater terms were explained clearly.\nStudents found Professor Alexander Haynes highly knowledgeable about the material and skills, while also friendly and engaged if students had questions. One respondent described the class environment as \u201cthe best blend of casual and professional,\u201d and many others emphasized the collaborative atmosphere fostered by the instructors. Although some of the concepts were introduced quickly, all the reviewers said Professor Haynes and other instructors were more than willing to help with questions. In fact, many students said that the most important thing was just to ask for help if you weren\u2019t sure what to do next. The consensus was that the professors were enthusiastic and approachable.\nThe course was structured around readings and reading quizzes, a paper in response to a play, individual projects, and then a collaborative project as a class to design production sets. Reviewers loved the hands-on learning approach of the class and praised how it was always a different, exciting experience each time. The later parts of the courses, especially the independent projects, were very student-driven and allowed students to explore their interests. Most respondents noted that work was concentrated within class hours, and there wasn\u2019t much work outside of class time.\nMany students raved that this was one of the most fun courses they\u2019d ever taken at Brown. Even for non-TAPS concentrators, it was unanimous that the different learning environment and acquisition of hands-on skills made this an extremely worthwhile class. To avoid getting confused, some respondents recommended getting to the readings as early as possible and always making sure to ask for clarification rather than trying to stumble through something alone.

In the words of one respondent, \"He didn't teach. He just spouted facts.\" While he urged students to participate in class, reviewers noted that he was hard to get a hold of outside of the classroom and that \"feedback was confusing when given.\" Despite his teaching, several students commented positively on his personality, calling him \"incredibly kind.\"\nThe workload for the class consisted of three papers and several presentations, along with a final paper and performance. Class members disliked the large quantity of reading, which they considered \"very dense\" and \"overly erudite.\"\nTime spent on this course varied wildly: some didn't put in any time outside of class, while others reportedly did 12 hours of work a week. However, regardless of the effort expended, survey respondents generally agreed that the class was unrewarding.

No prior experience with theatre or design is required to participate in TAPS1208G!\nOne student noted, \u201cthe instruction team was an absolute blast!\u201d Professor Renee Suprenant Fitzgerald focused on Set Design, Professor Ron Cesario focused on Costume Design, Professor Tim Hett focused on Lighting Design, and Professor Alex Eizenberg focused on Sound Design. Overall, reviewers felt rotating between professors for each unit was well organized and fun. Reviewers noted, \u201cthe professors were all very passionate about their work and were very kind and accommodating to everyone in the class.\u201d Classes were described as only being lecture-based during the beginning of the semester before transitioning to student presentations of their work completed that day. Given the frequency of student presentations, reviewers wished there was more instruction-driven teaching during class time, an aspect that might be improved upon the next time this course is taught. Nevertheless, respondents appreciated that each part of the semester was dedicated to a certain professor\u2019s topic as it made the concepts easier to understand.\nAssignments were due every class in TAPS1280G, but they were classified/organized by \u201cproject.\u201d Thus, these assignments revolved around reading two plays. Four individual projects - focused on the four facets of the course - were assigned alongside a partnered final project. This final group project might revolve around lighting/scenic or costumes/sound and involved designing an element for a show. TAPS1280G also required in-class presentations and two design take-home quizzes. These quizzes asked students to apply design concept knowledge.\nIf you\u2019re hoping to think creatively and gain experience in theatrical design, \u201cIntroduction to Theatrical Design\u201d might be the perfect class for you! Prospective students are encouraged to take advantage of office hours given the passion and fun nature of the four professors. While design projects are cited as very fun, reviewers want to remind prospective students of the importance of time management: \u201cTAPS1280G is not super time consuming but the projects are consistent in their length and difficulty and assigned for every class, so it may feel like a lot of work to do an assignment between Wednesday and Friday.\u201d Overall, prospective students should be prepared to create their own designs for plays in four main elements within the field!\n\ninstructor: Instructors\nRenee Fitzgerald\nrenee_fitzgerald@brown.edu\nRonald Cesario\nronald_cesario@brown.edu\nTimothy Hett\ntimothy_hett@brown.edu\n\nschedule: Schedule and Location\nWF 1pm-2:50pm in 50 John Street 120\n\naverage_hours: 3.60\n\nmax_hours: 8.20\n\ncourse_rating: 60%\n4.05\n\nprofessor_rating: 67%\n4.50\n\nprofessor_and_term: TAPS 1280G | Fitzgerald, Renee (S1) | Fall 2020\n\n", "code: TAPS 1280K\n\nterm: Fall 2024\n\ntitle: Mindfulness and Movement: Interoceptive Expressive Arts\n\ndescription: This course cultivates and mobilizes interoceptive awareness as a means of self-expression.

Reviewers commented on how she taught students about life and empowered them to employ their knowledge inside and outside the acting world. She valued open discussion and expected students\u2019 full presence and active participation. She gave direct feedback that was very helpful and salient, while allowing students to also critique one another.\nAssignments included a handful of papers, scenes, monologues, and presentations spaced throughout the semester.

Lewis beyond what is on the page. The course intends to apply his writings to better understand Lewis\u2019 perspective on modern humanity and society at large. There are no prerequisites for the course and students noted that no background is necessary to succeed.\nProfessor Flanigan was praised by respondents for being incredibly kind, supportive, and engaging. In particular, he was noted to be very accommodating to students\u2019 needs and asked excellent questions to facilitate class discussion. Other than that, however, the instructor was noted to be relatively hands-off and allowed students to lead most discussions. Professor Flanigan always wanted to hear the opinions of students and enjoyed a more personal spin relevant to their own lives.\nThe bulk of the assignments for this course consisted of reading one book a week and a midterm and final paper. Students could choose to complete a project in lieu of the essay, so long as they first discussed their project plan with the instructor. Every student also led a discussion on one of the weekly assigned readings, which were noted to be very fun and casual. The discussions could sometimes be heavy on religious topics, but did not alienate students of different religious backgrounds. The professor would also facilitate the discussion occasionally.\nOverall, reviewers greatly enjoyed and highly recommended this course. As discussions tended to be more about students\u2019 overall reactions and feelings toward readings rather than literary analysis, students felt the class was very accessible to those normally averse to discussion-based courses.

The course is designed for STEM concentrators who have an interest in teaching but is open to anyone. There are no official prerequisites for this course, however, students did find prior teaching experience to be helpful but not necessary.\nReviewers found Professor Christina Smith to be an excellent and caring teacher. Multiple reviewers noted how accommodating Professor Smith was regarding extenuating circumstances. Professor Smith had clearly laid out expectations for every assignment and was very well-organized throughout the course. Professor Smith also strongly encouraged participation among students and would hold class discussions. One reviewer commented that Professor Smith was \u201cthe best professor I\u2019ve had at Brown.\u201d\nCourse assignments included readings for every class, weekly discussion posts, one weekly mini-essay, and a final group project.

Crafted by Professor Andre Willis, the not-for-credit, online course provided a weekly discussion space designed to connect the Brown community in conversations over relevant concepts. Discussions were centered on weekly themes such as Freedom, Love, or Power. The themes were interwoven with modern-day topics and debates, integrating social justice, political dissonance, and the COVID-19 pandemic into the classroom. The class has no prerequisites, with one student stating \u201cbeing a human\u201d as useful preparation.\nWith the entire class revolving around discussion, Professor Willis created a welcoming environment where students felt secure sharing personal stories and opinion. The comfortability and informality aided conversations to include many voices and respondents found them generally productive. Willis was repeatedly commended for his communication skills and student interactions. \u201c[The instructor] sees the students as humans first and not just students,\u201d one respondent described.\nBeing a non-credit class, UNIV1111 has one of the lightest course loads on offer at Brown. Outside of discussions, students were expected to read short readings or watch videos dealing with the weekly theme. Readings were often based in philosophy or modern news and students would present on them to jumpstart the conversation. Sometimes, in lieu of class, students were invited to lectures Professor Willis was giving to a larger audience at Brown. Students never spent more than three hours a week on the course, and even the weekly discussion was an optional component of the class.\nLooking back on such a unique class, respondents generally had a positive experience. They enjoyed having discussions rooted in the current cultural scene and the opportunity to learn from peers in a welcoming class that \u201cdoesn\u2019t really feel like an academic space at all.\u201d Even simpler, some students\u2019 highlight of the class was just getting to know Professor Willis over the semester. A few respondents felt the conversations often centered on a vocal minority of participants, and the lack of structure could generate repetitive groupthink. The course format in Zoom was also seen as suboptimal by some, but they were still excited to see the class run in the in-person future.\n\ninstructor: Instructors\nAndre Willis\nandre_willis@brown.edu\nTricia Rose\ntricia_rose@brown.edu\n\nschedule: Schedule and Location\nTTh 1pm-2:20pm Location TBD\n\nprograms: Curricular Programs\nRace, Power, and Privilege (RPP)\n\naverage_hours: 0.93\n\nmax_hours: 1.21\n\ncourse_rating: 78%\n3.88\n\nprofessor_rating: 56%\n4.87\n\nprofessor_and_term: UNIV 1111 | Willis, Andre (S1) | Fall 2020\n\n", "code: UNIV 1211\n\nterm: Fall 2024\n\ntitle: Brown Experiential Learning Practicum\n\ndescription: This course is an optional 1-credit seminar for students participating in an off-campus semester internship.

This introductory course examines questions of inequality in planning, the environmental and human impact of urban growth, identity and solidarity in cities, and the challenges cities face today. Students recommended no specific background in the subject aside from general historical knowledge and writing ability.\nProfessor Lauren Yapp was exceedingly well-reviewed by students who appreciated her enthusiasm, personability, and engaging presentation style. Lectures were typically interactive and involved some level of discussion, and respondents noted Professor Yapp\u2019s insightful and thought-provoking questions. She was passionate, receptive to students\u2019 needs, and made herself available for feedback. Grading in the class was fair and somewhat timely.\nAssignments included readings, weekly reading responses, two papers, and a creative final project. Respondents characterized the readings as mostly worthwhile, but some were less interested than others. The class material was useful and not too difficult, and students spent an average of around three hours per week on classwork, with a maximum of about nine hours spent in a week.\nStudents found the class interesting and rewarding overall, though most noted that the class was fairly basic. Respondents called it a \u201cgreat course for students who want to explore Urban Studies,\u201d but cautioned those who already have a background in urban studies to take a more advanced course.

What political and ethical avenues do you need to navigate before you start drafting plans? \"Fieldwork in the Urban Community\" aims to answer these questions by offering an introduction to urban planning. While there were no official prerequisites, most respondents found a prior background in urban studies handy. An introductory course, such as \"The City: Introduction to Urban Studies\" was useful.\nStudents lauded Professor Azar for being \"down-to-earth and accessible,\" leading engaging discussions, and offering good advice. Classes struck a balance between lecture and discussion; Professor Azar created helpful PowerPoints to summarize major points. He was not always available outside of class, but he did make time for questions and one-on-one meetings.\nCourse requirements consisted of one paper, ten journal entries, class readings and participation, and a semester-long fieldwork placement. For the most part, students found this level of work appropriate, although several wished that the readings had been fewer in number and that the \"fieldwork component had been better integrated\" into the course.\nRespondents spent about six hours a week on the course, though this number rose when major assignments were due. While this course was interesting, they also recommended \"Downtown Development\" (URBN1870D), \"Urban Economics\" (ECON1410), and \"Geographical Analysis of Society.\" Students recommended the course but with the caveat that prospective students \"choose [their] fieldwork carefully.\" Others advocated for an earlier class time and better-facilitated the discussion.

Students take on the role of planners, developers, and city residents, using Providence as a laboratory through which to explore broader concepts. The course also incorporates field trips, public meetings, and guest lectures. No prerequisites are required for this course, although some students wrote that familiarity with local government, microeconomics, and previous classes in the Urban Studies department were at times beneficial.\nProfessor Robert Azar was widely praised for his knowledge and passion for urban planning; as someone who worked full-time as a planner in Providence, his personal anecdotes and connections were very engaging and reinforced concepts covered in class. Several respondents reflected that they loved hearing his stories about the conflicts and drama in local governance and that his experience and depth of understanding allowed him to respond effectively to student questions and interests. Professor Azar frequently used maps and GIS systems from the Providence Planning Department to provide real examples of course content. The class was largely lecture-based, which some students noted was different from other seminar courses they had previously taken. Some reviewers wished that more class debates would be held, or that the professor might ask more open-ended questions to encourage discussion. One student wrote that Professor Azar would sometimes hold class outside and seemed to care a lot about getting to know the students and hearing about their own home cities.\nAssignments consisted of weekly readings, four papers, and two in-class presentation-based projects. The 4 to 5 weekly readings were sometimes supplemented by short and entertaining news articles. These also covered a variety of sources, including court cases, laws and zoning ordinances, comprehensive plans, and chapters from history books. Previous final exams involved a 10-minute presentation to present students\u2019 final papers to the class. Rather than following a specific question of argument, students were prompted to provide their personal insight and perspective to a city of their choice. One reviewer mentioned that this particular assignment was somewhat stressful and would have benefitted from a clearer plan. In addition, students were sometimes asked to reach out to community members for interviews, which some people felt was invasive and unnecessary for the scope of the assignment. Most students agreed that the class was very interesting and not overly demanding, especially given its WRIT designation.\nClass members highly recommended this course to any aspiring planner or curious student wanting to better understand the built environment and the complex bureaucracy that shapes it. One student called it \u201cthe most practical course at Brown if you want to better understand how local government works.\u201d They went on to say that Professor Azar \u201ccompletely demystifies the land development process and introduces all of the main relevant actors.\u201d Students found the workload very manageable but advised prospective students to begin writing assignments as early as possible.

The course is open to students of all concentrations and has no prerequisites. It is also a basic requirement for many upper-level Visual Arts courses, as well as for students wishing to cross-register at RISD. However, the course is highly sought after; it is recommended that students intending to take the course participate in the course lottery, released the semester prior, as securing a spot can often be competitive (though still possible) during shopping period.\nProfessor Becci Davis was described as helpful and \u201cclear in communicating her expectations and instructions\u201d. Students particularly appreciated the frequent opportunities Professor Davis provided for asking questions and receiving feedback. It was mentioned that she would often walk around the class to give \u201cspecific and useful advice\u201d to each student, and she would encourage clarification by asking for questions after each slide during in-class presentations.\nThe course assignments and workload were dependent on the section and the instructor, but Professor Davis was described to largely assign sketchbook practices, given daily as per the syllabus. Other assignments included projects, blog entries and responses, and artworks responding to visiting artists\u2019 presentations. Alongside classwork, it was recommended students devote their own time to developing and honing their artistic skills.\nOverall, the class was described as fun, engaging, and also clear, with the professor effectively communicating expectations for all classwork and assignments. Though prior artistic background is not explicitly necessary, respondents found that taking high school art classes and being generally passionate about art helped prepare them for this course.\n\ninstructor: Instructors\nSusanna Koetter\nsusanna_koetter@brown.edu\n\nschedule: Schedule and Location\nMW 10am-11:50am in List Art Center 325\n\naverage_hours: 3.00\n\nmax_hours: 4.67\n\ncourse_rating: 36%\n3.88\n\nprofessor_rating: 46%\n4.89\n\nprofessor_and_term: VISA 0100 | Davis, Becci (S5) | Fall 2023\n\n", "code: VISA 0120\n\nterm: Fall 2024\n\ntitle: Foundation Media\n\ndescription: \u201cFoundation Media\u201d (VISA0120) is a course designed to familiarize students with video, sound, and interactive media production. The course is a requirement for those concentrating in Visual Arts, though it is also accessible to non-concentrators. Some respondents agreed that no background is necessary, but others remarked that familiarity with audio and visual editing software (e.g. Adobe Suite and Audacity) could be useful.\nProfessor Leah Beeferman was consistently described as passionate, engaging, and supportive. Centering discussion and peer feedback in her courses, Leah shared her technical knowledge by demonstrating media editing techniques while also allowing students to explore their own interests and ideas. She presented effectively and made efficient use of class time, creating a comfortable and safe space for students to present work during critiques. Following project viewings, Leah provided thorough, fair, and helpful feedback in person, connecting students\u2019 works to their previous ones and commenting on how their work improved and could be improved further. However, this input could at times be lengthy and impede class progression.\nAssignments in this course consisted of weekly projects and occasional readings and video or sound pieces that introduced concepts to be explored in projects. This course also included one partner project. Students generally did not find the projects difficult and emphasized that, because the projects are open-ended, the time and effort put into the class depended per person. Assignments expanded on one other and were designed to encourage personal expression.\nIf you seek to explore your creativity with digital media, VISA0120 is the course for you, especially with Professor Leah Beeferman. The class exposes students to the niche and increasingly popular fine arts, time-based media of visual and audio art and introduces technical aspects of art production, occasionally through a commercial and practical lens.\n\ninstructor: Instructors\nBecci Davis\nrebecca_davis1@brown.edu\n\nschedule: Schedule and Location\nMW 5pm-6:50pm in List Art Center 315\n\naverage_hours: 4.33\n\nmax_hours: 9.33\n\ncourse_rating: 83%\n4.14\n\nprofessor_rating: 54%\n4.70\n\nprofessor_and_term: VISA 0120 | Beeferman, Leah (S1) | Fall 2021\n\n", "code: VISA 0130\n\nterm: Fall 2024\n\ntitle: Sculpture Foundation\n\ndescription: \"3-D Foundation\" (VISA0130) is a course that teaches the fundamentals of three-dimensional design and construction, with a focus on projects and the correct use of tools.

Course reviewers were pleased by his passion for the subject and enjoyed how the class was run in a casual way, with students referring to the professor simply as \"Eddie.\" However, some respondents said that the class sometimes seemed too relaxed and time was not managed well, as not all students took the course seriously. Overall, reviewers found Eddie incredibly available for assistance.\nWork for this course consisted of four projects, one for each unit, and a final project. Respondents felt that the projects provided them the freedoms necessary to develop their artistic capabilities, but also noted that there was sufficient guidance provided so they did not ever feel lost. Students commented that while the projects were relatively easy, they did require a lot of time to complete due to the nature of the class. Overall, all of the work was considered fun and useful to the course topics.\nDespite complaints about the laid-back nature of the course, many students considered the relaxed atmosphere a benefit and praised Eddie for his engaging and enjoyable classes. The consensus of respondents did feel that the classes could have had better time management, as often too much was fit into a single time block. Yet, most students were happy with the amount they learned, with many mentioning their excitement about learning to weld. Overall, class members recommended VISA0130 as a great class to take for a solid foundation in 3-D design.\n\ninstructor: Instructors\nDaniel Stupar\ndaniel_stupar@brown.edu\n\nschedule: Schedule and Location\nW 1pm-4:50pm in List Art Center B10\n\naverage_hours: 3.15\n\nmax_hours: 8.67\n\ncourse_rating: 78%\n4.56\n\nprofessor_rating: 78%\n4.62\n\nprofessor_and_term: VISA 0130 | Villanueva, Eduardo (S1) | Spring 2015\n\n", "code: VISA 0140\n\nterm: Fall 2024\n\ntitle: Photography Foundation\n\ndescription: This class is a wide ranging technical and conceptual introduction to photography.

Learning goals of this class include acquiring proficiency in the use of electronic image production tools as well as developing literacy in screen media work. The course consists of collaborative studio exercises with students submitting and commenting on each other\u2019s work.\nProfessor Leah Beeferman\u2019s instructional style was appreciated by class members. In-class demonstrations were said to be \u201cconcise\u201d and \u201cextremely effective\u201d at introducing the tools necessary to complete assignments. Some students felt that presentations of other artists\u2019 work were less engaging than those aimed at learning new techniques, but overall lectures were said to be interesting and helpful. Professor Beeferman\u2019s focus on individual style and artistic development was also appreciated.\nThe course workload included weekly readings, reading responses, and digital sketchbook assignments. Additionally, there were five larger projects spread throughout the semester. Respondents noted that although enjoyable, assignments could be time-consuming. Despite this, the projects gave students the freedom to explore their own ideas, with the course structure emphasizing finding your own \u201cvisual voice.\"\nOverall, students found \u201cDigital 2D Foundation\u201d to be an excellent introduction to the medium for anyone interested in producing digital art.

Although there are no official prerequisites, students felt that having any VISA class, especially VISA0100, was helpful but not necessary.\nStudents praised Professor Wesley Sanders\u2019 teaching. They described Professor Sanders (or \"Wes\") as a very encouraging and accommodating professor who was dedicated to class members\u2019 success in the course. Professor Sanders was even noted to take time outside of class to help students with the course with one student noting that he provided the student with extra guidance with the woodworking machines which was greatly appreciated. Professor Sanders' passion for the subject was clear in how skilled he was at facilitating critique and how he included painting demos and examples to help inspire students for each project.\nCoursework for the class included various projects that grew in length throughout the semester with projects initially being weekly and gradually progressing into two to three weeks per project. All projects included an in-class critique, and longer projects also included studio days. There were also occasional readings about color theory and paint throughout the semester.\nThis class is highly recommended for anyone of any skill level willing to put in the time and effort to engage with acrylic painting. Everything about the environment, from the professor to fellow classmates\u2019 passion to the project prompts themselves, created an atmosphere of learning and community that students greatly enjoyed.\n\ninstructor: Instructors\nZoila Andrea Coc-Chang\nzoila_andrea_coc-chang@brown.edu\n\nschedule: Schedule and Location\nTh 1pm-4:50pm in List Art Center 325\n\naverage_hours: 5.33\n\nmax_hours: 11.00\n\ncourse_rating: 80%\n4.00\n\nprofessor_rating: 46%\n4.89\n\nprofessor_and_term: VISA 0160 | Sanders, Wesley (S1) | Fall 2022\n\n", "code: VISA 1110\n\nterm: Fall 2024\n\ntitle: Drawing\n\ndescription: \"Drawing I\" (VISA1110) is a Visual Arts course that focuses on developing students' ability to draw \"nature, still life, the model, and the imagination.\" VISA0100 or VISA0110 are the only formal prerequisites, but respondents noted that previous art or drawing experience was helpful.\nClass members described Professor Evans' teaching style as relaxed and supportive. However, some students felt that they would have benefited less from lectures and more from practice during class time. Reviewers noted that Professor Evans gave useful feedback but occasionally was unresponsive to emails on days when class did not meet.\nThe course mainly consisted of in-class project work. Students reported that the only homework was drawing five to ten minutes daily. The assignments seemed to be manageable and respondents believed that they were only \"as difficult as you wanted them to be.\" One student noted that \"assignments allowed us to explore our interests and fully embrace the course goals.\" Reviewers reported that assignments were relevant and provided the opportunity to learn \"a lot about both drawing techniques and the philosophies around art.\"\nThe most memorable aspect of this course for students seemed to be the \"great, supportive, relaxed\" classroom environment that Professor Evans cultivated. One respondent noted that this allowed students to \"grow as artists and people\". Another student was thankful that \"drawing has become not just something to do, but a way of interacting with and being present with my surroundings\".

Reviewers noted that she was always available to talk outside of class and gave great one-on-one feedback.\nThe coursework for the course consisted of various print/collage projects, including projects explaining a variety of printmaking techniques. Students described them as minimally structured, so mostly individualized work. Class members enjoyed the free form and variable nature of the projects, noting that it helped them with experimentation and learning techniques. In addition, they could put in as much time as they wanted and familiarity with techniques helped the process. Also, reviewers felt they were pushed very effectively to challenge their own work, but not painfully hard.\nAs a whole, students greatly enjoyed the class, especially its incredibly open and student guided nature.

Reviewers found drawing and painting experience to be highly useful for this class, and some thought that having taken another printmaking class would also have helped.\nProfessor Friese was described as enthusiastic and always ready to provide individual feedback to students. One reviewer appreciated that she took into account different skill levels, and another commented that she allowed them to personalize the class experience. Students stated that her teaching was effective, in particular the demonstrations she conducted for each technique, but some felt that she could have given more specific assignments and suggestions. However, one class member wrote that her love and enthusiasm for printmaking made learning from her a great experience, and the class agreed that she was very encouraging.\nThere were few assigned readings, but those that were assigned most students found useful. The class was described as being very experiential. Students completed weekly assignments and critiques, an artist bio, a midterm assignment and critique, and a final portfolio.\nThe workload matched some students' expectations, while the rest thought that it was more than expected. They generally spent as little as five and as much as twenty-five hours on the class per week, the latter especially when the final project was due. Still, students would recommend the class, though one reviewer commented that the class was not for advanced printmakers, and suggested taking other printmaking classes and those involving art techniques like Painting I, Drawing I, and Silkscreen.

Reviews about the usage of class time were mixed, with some survey respondents complaining that the time given for in-class work was too long, while others thought it was too short. However, everyone appreciated that Professor Butler was always available during class if they needed help while working on their projects. A few people complained about the uneven pacing of the course, but most were generally satisfied.\nCoursework included two large projects, a few small projects (mainly introductory exercises for the programs) at the beginning of the semester, and a film screening.

One respondent indicated that they most appreciated the feedback from the visiting artists, but thought that the gallery visits detracted from in-class work time.\nIn all, students completed seven paintings in the class, along with one presentation. The assignments were open-ended, once again keeping the focus on the individual student\u2019s interests and artistic interpretations. There were also a number of readings on contemporary art history or relevant artistic themes, which were usually followed by a class discussion.

As this is an honors seminar, prerequisites include many visual arts courses. Students in VISA1800C often had taken several VISA courses, such as \"Studio Foundation\" (VISA0100) and \"Painting: Beginning to Intermediate\" (VISA1310), among others. Additionally, many students had film experience and had taken course in the Modern Culture and Media department.

Leigh's teaching style was generally praised by members of the class. Her ability to help students achieve their personal goals, to carry on good discussion, and to produce helpful feedback and art critiques was widely recognized. Leigh was often available to meet outside of class. Respondents believed they would have been more successful in the course had more rigid deadlines been set. Several class members believed they became complacent due to the lack of strict cutoff dates for submitting material.\nThis class was a large time commitment for most students. Respondents generally spent around fourteen hours per week on this class. Class assignments included three short written reflections, two group shows, reading assignments, discussions, presentation of work, and group critiques. Future classes will include trips to New York and Boston to visit galleries, museums, and artists' studios.\nStudents believed this class was \"like no other.\" The combination of a supportive professor and intriguing, \"brilliant\" classmates made this course memorable.

Students are also introduced to Yoruba literature, theater, and music. There are no official prerequisites for this course, but an interest in learning one of the most widely spoken African languages in the world would certainly be of no harm.\nProfessor Olufeyisayo Soetan was widely praised by respondents for her skill in teaching tough linguistic concepts and techniques through interaction and conversation. She was described as humorous, caring, and dedicated to her students, being very receptive to comments, helpful when answering questions, and hands-on with difficulties. Reviewers emphasized that she was respectful of all proficiency and knowledge levels and never expressed judgment with mispronunciations. Professor Soetan also always included knowledge on her cultural background that was greatly valued, as many students were also of Yoruba heritage. Outside of class, she was noted to be warm and welcoming to her students.\nAssignments consisted of daily listening and reading homework, a few vocabulary quizzes throughout the semester, one in-class midterm, one in-class final exam, two to three individual projects (some of which were video submissions), and one final group project. Students commented on the high time commitment required for such a constant flow of assignments but generally deemed the work necessary for learning the language, despite the occasional difficulty (particularly with tones). Participation and active listening were expected during lessons. Feedback on assignments was available and useful, and grades were returned fairly and promptly.\nOverall, students highly recommended this class for shoppers interested in learning Yoruba. This introductory course to the West African language was described to be a fun, beginner-friendly, and worthwhile class that encourages students to learn about a language and culture with an engaging instructor.\n\ninstructor: Instructors\nVictor Alabi\nvictor_alabi@brown.edu\n\nschedule: Schedule and Location\nMWF 2pm-2:50pm in Sciences Library 604\n\nprograms: Curricular Programs\nFirst Half of Year Course (YC01)\n\naverage_hours: 4.00\n\nmax_hours: 7.75\n\ncourse_rating: 52%\n4.53\n\nprofessor_rating: 88%\n4.96\n\nprofessor_and_term: YORU 0100 | Soetan, Olufeyisayo (S1) | Fall 2021\n\n", "code: YORU 0110\n\nterm: Summer 2024\n\ntitle: Introduction to Yoruba\n\ndescription: This is a Yor\u00f9b\u00e1 language and culture course.
